I feel the Lost Missions episode where the two of them duel Dooku exemplifies their style best, Anakin and Obi-Wan are often described as two halves of a single nearly unstoppable fighter, Anakin is their unrelenting offense and Obi-Wan is their unbreakable defense, sure, a lot of the Jedi fight side by side, but rewatching that aforementioned duel especially you notice that their movements blend into each other, compared to most other duels where the two Jedi just take turns. I feel it did a lot to lend legitimacy to the idea of Anakin and Obi-Wan being two of the most skilled and close Jedi in the order.",Anyone else love the scenes where Anakin and Obi-Wan duel side by side?,0

"Just my opinion based on liking the character. Not exactly thrilled with his character origins, but not disappointed either. I think that a Boba Fett movie would be awesome if it was done one of two ways.

1. Done like Dredd. It’s Boba Fett on a high value target... Possibly partnered with other Bounty Hunter(s). Post ROTS, pre ANH. Not a ton of locations. More of a showcase of his abilities tracking down a target, delivering, getting paid. Never removes helmet (possibly one shot where Daniel Logan puts on/takes off the helmet. Have Boba Fett played primarily by stuntmen. Not tied to any other films in any critical way. Just a small, self contained day in the life of Boba Fett during a challenging bounty. Violent, pushing the extremes of a PG-13 rating.

2. Post Return of the Jedi. Disoriented Fett escapes Sarlacc pit. Tracks Han back to Cloud city where Imperial holdouts are making one of their last stands. Tons of callbacks. Made about five years from now, uses Solo actors to reprise their roles with the Han and Lando scenes on Cloud City. Ties in heavily to Last Jedi. Boba Fett and Solo end up in a truce. Twist to the Boba Fett story is that we discover that Jango Fett had multiple clones of Boba Fett made, and they’re all active.",What I want from a Boba Fett movie,0

"In the Clone Wars, when Palpatine became displeased with Count Dooku, he outright force choked him from half a galaxy away.

This is far, far beyond what any other Sith can do. Even Darth Vader could merely force choke someone on the same ship as him, and that was with a regular human.

If Palpatine was so powerful, what was stopping him from randomly getting into holograms with his enemies, then force choking them immediately?",How did Palpatine force-choke Dooku from half a galaxy away?,0
"Hi /r/StarWars. So without getting into whether or not I personally liked the film, I wanted to offer my perspective on why I think people both rabidly love and intensely hate this movie. To me, it boils down to the nature of tragedy in fiction. I think it’s obvious that there’s nothing inherently wrong with telling a sad story. If you play your cards right, a tragic ending can be thematically resonant and provide catharsis for the viewer or reader. You may feel sad in the short term, but it’s ultimately an uplifting experience. 

But what happens when a writer doesn’t play their cards right? What happens when your story seems to be sadness and cruelty for the sake of sadness and cruelty? Then you are just left with those shitty feelings. You never get your catharsis because apparently there wasn’t any point to the struggles your characters have been through. It has just been sadness for the sake of sadness. 

I want to share a quick story about what gave me this perspective. I’m a big Batman fan and in the current ongoing series, Batman was supposed to be married. In the end, though, his bride-to-be calls off the wedding because she feels as though Bruce can’t be happy *and* be Batman. That left a really bitter taste in my mouth (along with a lot of other fans) because it’s one of Batman’s oldest cliches. Even in The Dark Knight, the most popular depiction of the character in modern times, plays with the idea that his happiness is incompatible with his mission. So when Batman is left at the altar, we’re left feeling sad and angry, but without any interesting reason for doing it. It seems like the writer is being mean to Batman just for the sake of being mean to Batman. 

Which brings us to the character of Luke Skywalker. There is no denying that TLJ turns Luke’s story into a very sad, tragic tale. He is broken and lonely in his old age. So why would a writer do this to such a beloved character? The answer is, to tell a story that is worthy of that sadness. Rian Johnson used that tragedy as thematic fuel for the narrative he was telling. Fans of the film will feel that the quality of the story justifies that kind of tragedy. Detractors of the film will gain no closure from the story, and are therefore just left feeling shitty and sorry for Luke. I think that’s why you see so many people saying the film left them feeling sad and angry after watching it. They never got their resolution, so those feelings just sit there and ferment. 

I’m aware that people have problems with TLJ that go beyond Luke’s treatment. I totally understand that. But if the movie had merely been mediocre in their eyes, people would have disliked it, not hated it as passionately as they do. 

TL;DR - Fans of TLJ feel that making Luke’s story a tragedy was justified by the story, people who hate the film feel that it did not. ",Why I think The Last Jedi was so divisive and the nature of tragedy in fiction,0
"I mean, I understand from a dramatic perspective that having guys picked off one by one adds to the tension, but was there ever a stated reason that three guys had to do the trench run together? Two just seem to sit there and do nothing but get picked off. 

I think one of them says something about ""holding off"" Vader and the two other TIEs, but quite how he was doing that escapes me. Unless they were being human shields, just there to physically block the Imperials from shooting the leader? 

Tactically, wouldn't it have made more sense to have the two wingmen out of the trench and ""higher"" (relative to the Death Star) than the leader, that way they could dive down and shoot at the back of any TIE trying to get onto the leader's six? 

Overthinking maybe, but I'm wondering if I missed an in-universe explanation for the tactic? ",A New Hope: What were the trench run wingmen supposed to be doing?,0

"So yeah, what do you guys think is the most efficient Star Wars fleet? Keep in mind factors such as limited resources and political factors.

​

Personally, I think my ""dream fleet"" would look something like this:

Primary Battlecruiser: Bulwark Mk. 3. The Bulwark has lots of cargo space, high firepower and great shielding, but is fairly expensive but is known for sometimes having complications in electronics and sensors, and I would obviously get that fixed. The Bulwark would be the main frontline ship for my fleet, having good shields and high firepower, plus the cargo space which could be used for fighters and troop transport.

​

Carrier: Venator-Class Star Destroyer. The Venator, thanks to its ventral hangar, can deploy fighters in record time. With some modifications to improve its hangar space, the Venator would make a great addition to my fleet.​

&amp;#x200B;

Corvette: CR90 Blockade Runner: Small, fast, maneuverable and very modifiable, the CR90 is perfect alongside the Bulwark and MC60 as a screener ship, dealing with fighters and smaller capital ships with its array of blaster cannons. This version would have some of its engines removed or significantly reduced in size to allow rear sightlines, making the ship significantly slower, but giving it a much more effective firing angle against enemy ships, and reducing any fuel or energy costs from the massive engine array.

&amp;#x200B;

Frigate: MC60. The MC60 is small, fast, and very durable for its small size, and would, in this case, be modified to have more point-defense cannons. It is also known for its ability to quickly release its load, allowing for clusterbombs, proximity mines or even just random scrap to be released quickly, giving the MC60 extra utility.

​

Superiority Figher: HMP Droid Gunship. This gunship is big, decently well-shielded, and has huge firepower, and independently rotating cannons, allowing it to attack multiple enemies at once. This fighter, being very expensive, would be fairly rare, but would act as a great supportive element for the cheaper fighters, especially with its variety of missiles.

​

Swarm Fighter: Droid TIE Fighters. The Empire has experimented with droid-controlled TIE fighters, and considering the way TIE fighters are designed to be used, this sounds like a great idea. These TIEs would have a redesigned wing pattern to make them a little smaller, and be more easily crammed together in a ship, and would be released in large groups together, using their droid nature to coordinate group attacks and have great reflexes. These TIEs would be given photon bombs instead of missiles, and would be commonly used for risky mass bombing runs and as a screen against enemy fighters.

​

Special Ordinance: Repair Missiles: Special missiles filled with small droids similar to the Buzz Droids from the Clone Wars, but instead of tearing ships apart, they would repair them. These would help extend the lifespan of fighters out in the field, especially the HMPs.

Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith The Videogame

To everyone here on Reddit who likes Dueling and/or PVP/PVE games, and/or also like  Star Wars and the untold lore around Ep. 3. This game is for you! i love  this game personally and have beaten it many times.

it has  superb combat and amazing duels against classic characters as well as  characters not introduced in the movies, as well as fighting against  never before seen droids and clone fighter types. the levels in game  explore famous scenes from the movies while going much deeper into the  plot, narrative and story-telling.

Along with a versus mode where you can plug in a second controller and try to best your friend/enemy in a test of skill and might!

Above is a Unlock-able Alternate  Ending. no need to explain, just watch the video, it show cases the  beautiful combat and story-telling the game has to offer.

i could  go on for days about this game and love it from the bottom of my soul.i  sincerely hope you will love playing it as much as i do.

You will have to get your old PS2 or OG XBOX to play this. And as long as your console works well enough, you'll be able to play this game  buttery-smooth and lag-free. Despite its slightly low level graphics, it  makes up for it in fluid story telling and gameplay and Lore-Expansion. ",Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith The Videogame,0
"All other Star Wars movies (Disney or otherwise) did very well overseas except Solo.  I personally didn’t think it was that bad of a movie and thought it was better than the one I liked the least (Attack of the Clones).  So what was it?  Just the fact that people didn’t like the Han Solo recast?  I mean they had to know it wouldn’t have made sense to have Harrison Ford play the part.

",So I am looking for a serious opinion here. Why do you think Solo didn’t resonate with the foreign markets?,0
"I’ve noticed throughout the Star Wars Saga that 4 different colors of blaster bolts/ship laser bolts are used:

Red: Rebel blasters, Stormtrooper (Empire and FO) blasters, CIS blasters and Droideka/SBD wrist guns, X-Wings, A-Wings, Rebel Y-Wings, Rebel turbolasers, Vulture Droids, various factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Blue: Republic Blasters, Resistance Blasters, Ion charged weapons, when any gun is set to stun it fires blue circles, Republic Y-Wings, Republic turbolasers, various different factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Green: TIEs, Imperial turbolasers, Naboo Royal Guard blasters

Yellow: Mandalorian blasters


But I’ve never seen a satisfactory answer as to what they all mean in universe.  Obviously outside of universe the different colors are simply a design choice to make the battles look more colorful and to keep track of who’s who, but in universe it kind of seems like it should have an explanation.

I’ve seen a couple explanations, but none feel quite right:

1. The color is equal to the quality/type of gas used to create the bolt.
This theory posits that red bolts are lower quality gas, blue bolts are ion infused gas meant for taking down electronics/droids, and yellow and green are simply higher-end/more expensive gas

I like this theory, except it exposes a few problems, mostly with the blue gas being ion infused.  Blue bolts are used by both the Republic and the Resistance, along with many pirates and smugglers in TCW, if blue gas was ion infused, it would make sense for Clones to be using it as it would be more effective against droids, but the Resistance and the pirates in TCW would have no reason to use it.  Also, if blue lasers are better at taking down electronics, why wouldn’t all ships have blue lasers, regardless of faction?


2. The colors don’t change anything about the bolt, it’s simply a “tracer” or a way to know who’s firing at who.

This theory has more real world relevance, as real bullets will sometimes be used as “tracers” that leave little marks of color behind as they fly, this allows the shooter to see where he shot and readjust his aim accordingly, as well as to keep track of who is shooting what weapon.  This makes perfect sense in the Star Wars universe, except when it comes to the Rebels and the Empire.  If switching between colors was as simple as flipping a switch, and if it was common practice to use a different color than your enemy, why would the Rebels have kept their blasters at red?  It wouldn’t really make sense...

So, that’s why I’m curious if any of you guys have any theories or ideas as to what the different blaster colors could mean?

I know it doesn’t really matter, but I’m a sucker for these nitpicks details, and exploring the deep Star Wars Lore is one of my favorite things to do","So, can somebody give me the lowdown on Blaster Bolt colors?",0

"Okay this is just a minor thing but seeing as how I'm reading the book where this happens I felt like talking about it. I feel like it because it is my favorite book in the entire New Jedi Order series and includes one of my favorite Space Battles in all of Star Wars. A battle that is akbar's last great act. 

Destiny's way is all about being a turning point. not for the characters because most of them have already completed their major arcs for the series but for the war itself. And Akbar is front and center in this book. He is treated as this Wise Old Statesman who is sick and dying but wants to Still help save the Republic. He is shown being tired and physically frail and not being able to be out of the water much while still being intelligent and even having the president and the current leader of the galactic Navy offering him their spots.

At the end of the book he comes up with this large multi-layered trap that destroys the enemies ability to wage a offensive War. Sadly he does technically die off screen but he dies at the end of the battle so it's sort of a somber moment doing this great Victory where is the heroes realize that they have lost this great Statesman who was the one who gave them this victory.

now let's compare that to the ackbar we see in The Last Jedi. Instead of getting multiple scenes with the main characters and having one of the minor plots revolve around him he is in the background of two or three scenes. His death is also treated as just a minor footnote it happens in the background and he just gets lumped in with everybody else that died during the attack.

so yeah he did die off screen of peaceful old age in a book where he is Central to the plot of defeating the enemy. and yes books have more time than movies to develop characters and plot and blah blah blah but the book with all of its Pages didn't have to include Ackbar.","""at least Ackbar didn't die off screen like he did in Legends""",0

"Before the Jedi knights or Sith came into existence. The force sensitive people were known as the jed'aii. 

[This video is more in depth](https://youtu.be/zVtYgI8B_18)

They came before the jedi, and, unlike the jedi or sith did not get involved with planetary affairs and instead kept to themselves and focused on meditation on their home planet. But one thing I noticed is that their teachings are not focused on the dark side, or the light, their goal was to balance both dark and light. 

I could not help to bring this up because the first thing I thought of when hearing that was supreme leader snoke. Supreme leader snoke was obsessed with the balance of dark and light. He didn't only use the dark or only use the light. He used both the dark and the light, balanced. 

Even more so snoke leads the first order. And the jeda'ii were the first order to study the force. 

But one thing I hear you say is ""the jedaii were aincent, if snoke were a jedaii he wouldn't be alive.""

Then I ask you to look at Darth nihlus and Darth sion. Both Sith powerful enough to cheat death. If you use the force enough you can cheat death and keep yourself form dying form at least old age. Not necessarily form other people (ie: kylo killed snoke) but he can at least keep himself fkrm perishing from at least age. This would be why snoke hid himself in the outer religions until the Emporer was killed. Because he knew the Emporer was a threat. He could keep himself form dying form aging but he could stop himself form being killed by another force user. This is why he looks so disfigured, because he is so old and he has used the force to stop himself form death and most decay, but still ceases to look alive.

Personally I want it all back and don't see why it couldn't happen. Maybe with some tweaks. It would be awesome to see Shadows of the Empire produced as an animated feature or a full theatrical live action film with a fully recast Luke and Leia. 

I have great memories specifically of the musical score that was released alongside the novel. And I never owned an N64 but still managed to play the shit out of that game at a friend's house.

Anyhow, I think there is a lot of potential in SotE, so many iconic characters and world building.

"SPOILER WARNING - MENTIONS NEW MOVIES

So I've seen all of the new Disney Star Wars films, and despite all of the great and horrible missteps that they've made, one thing is really ticking me off. Where were all the jedi masters when Luke's New Jedi Order was massacred by Ben Solo/Kylo Ren? Ben attacked because he though Luke was going to kill him, and somehow destroyed the entire temple? We know that after Order 66, roughly 2% or 200 of the Jedi survived. Of these 200, about 100-140 were hunted down and killed by Vader and the Inquisitors or were turned to the dark side. So that leaves roughly 60 Jedi, if the stat I saw was correct. Now not all of these Jedi would join the new order, as some were opposed or self-eciled themselves. But at least some had to return, right? At least a dozen, if not more, of the Jedi would have rejoined to help train the future Jedi. But somehow, some untrained padawan-level Jedi is able to get a few of his friends and just destroy everything? 

And I know that those numbers are from the legends universe which isn't canon ectera ectera. But at the very least, what about the Jedi who Luke was training before Kylo/Ben? Kylo/Ben destroyed the New Order somewhere between 28 and 34 ABY. If the second Death Star was blown up in 4 ABY, then Luke had roughly 20 years to train other Jedi. Where were these ones? Or are we ment to belive that Kylo/Ben, who was the equivalent of a padawan learner, was able to gather a few of his friends and topple the rest of the Jedi who had been training for at least 20 years? And that each and every one of the New Order Jedi just happened to be at the new temple at the same time so that they could be killed by Kylo/Ben?

"Hi all,

Like most kids, my son loves all things Star Wars.  He especially likes listening to Star Wars audio books in the car.  Currently he is listening to the kids ""read along"" versions of the original trilogy, which are heavily abridged and only about 15 minutes long.  I grabbed a copy of the ""Dark Forces: Soldier of the Empire"" audio book from the library and I was blown away!  It had great voice acting and sound effects.  My son was enthralled listening to it.  Unfortunately it hit on a few too many adult themes (genocide, etc) for a six year old so we had to stop listening to the disappointment of the entire family.

So I'm searching for recommendations for another audio book along the same lines.  I like the dramatic ""radio play"" style of storytelling from the Dark Forces book, and the length seemed about perfect (2 hours).  I'm a lot less interested in the long unabridged versions of the novels.  Does anyone have any recommendation for similar books with less violence and adult themes?  It doesn't have to be kids versions of the stories, adult versions are fine, so long as they are appropriate.  I'm especially interested in audio books with the same level of production polish.",Star wars audio books for 6 year old?,0

"Luke didn't just see Ben Solo's future, but also his own, on the night he saw that Ben Solo was lost to the dark side. From that moment forward Luke knew he had two choices, *kill Ben Solo*, or *allow Kylo Ren to destroy everything he lives to protect*.

Luke is in a sort of purgatory on Ahch-To, he knows that if he joins The Resistance in battle he will eventually encounter Kylo, and when he does he will be faced with those two choices, *killing Kylo* (the choice he is disgusted with himself for even have considered for a brief moment), or *facing his own death*, and dying the way Obi-Wan did in his duel with Vader in A New Hope (allowing Kylo to strike him down will further strengthen the dark side's hold on Ben Solo).

Luke sees that living the life of the legendary warrior *Luke Skywalker* means he has to face this decision. So he walks away from his life as *Luke Skywalker*, removing himself from the story that is unfolding across the galaxy, and living the life of a farmer on Ahch-To, the sort of life he once dreamed of escaping on Tatooine before his name became legend. 

It's not until Luke sees a way to meet Kylo in battle, without having to make either of these choices, that he is freed from his *purgatory*, and becomes one with the force having completed his journey.

"We know they were both on Kashyyyk when Order 66 was enacted and it seems to me that, while very dangerous, the situation was still somewhat ideal to attempt locating Luminara and escaping with her:

- Yoda had beheaded the Commander (and I believe 2nd in command also) of Green company, meaning the clones would be somewhat disorganized
- The droid army was still very much active and engaged in live fighting with the clones so factions of the military would still be occupied with that
- Luminara was a well renown Jedi Master who could have proved very useful in the fight against the Sith

So I understand we don't know what will happen with Kylo during IX.  But just going off where Kylo is currently at, what do you think Ani would say to him?

•As of right now, the SW universe feels small. The governmental structure of the galaxy was destroyed (I guess) in TFA. Who is running this joint now?

So my question is, why did Anakin go through years of training with Obi Wan in order to be a Jedi, meanwhile Luke meets an old man who tells him about the force and that's it, Luke is man handling the force.

I feel this would have had the same wow factor to the kids, with less cheesiness to the adults. It would have also kept more in line with Yoda as a character, and shown his clear superiority to Dooku. It also would have kept more suspense for the moment Yoda finally draws his saber in battle against Sidious, then shown his small reguard for it when the sabers were cast aside as strength in the force became more the deciding factor. It would explain why Yoda never trained Luke on saber technique and focused on the force. He knew what Luke was going to have to defeat, and that a lightsaber would be a mere toy.

"Prior to TLJ when I won't join the Rebelsistance:

* The Rebelsistance has a somewhat significant army and fleet

* Luke Skywalker, a legendary jedi who defeated the Empire, is still alive

* The Rebelsistance has support from various groups/planets

* The Rebelsistance has connections to power-brokers and arms dealers within the galaxy, allowing them to arm their forces

* 5 Planets have been destroyed and have done nothing to rouse me to action


After TLJ:

* The Rebelsistance military is virtually non-existent. A small city's police force could handily defeat them at this point.

* Luke Skywalker is dead. Regardless of how ""inspiring"" his death was, it doesn't change the fact that the most valuable asset against the First Order did no lasting damage to it and is gone forever.

* Every ally the Rebelsistance had has abandoned them. 

* The Rebelsistance has suddenly grown a moral opposition to purchasing/using weapons in war. Of course, this doesn't really matter since 17% of the Rebelsistance's forces made a point of destroying any relationship they had with the galaxy's arms dealers, going so far as to steal the personal ship of one of their sellers.

* I don't believe in the Force, something that is essentially a myth in the galaxy at this point. Any mumbo-jumbo about Luke dying or being the ""spark that ignites the coals that rekindles the flame that burns the First Order"" falls on deaf ears.

Those who weren't killed by clones were decimated by a sith who stormed the jedi temple killing everyone in it. She also found out that the Republic that she swore to defend was being controlled and manipulated by a sworn enemy of her religion, who also orchestrated the downfall of her former mentor. After all that, she had found out about force sensitive  children being taken by the empire which probably would've brought her flashbacks to when Sidious attempted that during the clone wars and her and the babies nearly died. 

Let's not forget that she died and was brought back to life by a literal God whoch would definetly freak her out. She also found out that the man who had been known as the jedi hunter, the vile one who had led operation knightfall was her master who was like a brother to her.

This we can see by how none of the ""allies"" responds to Leia's pleas, and how the FO keeps saying that with the Resistance destroyed the last breath of the Republic will have died out. 

So maybe Kylo has a point, why are we still holding on? What is the point of keeping with the Idea of Republicanism, Resistance, Rebellion, whatever if there is nothing worth fighting for? If the galaxy actually gave two shits about liberty and justice they would've been up in arms and be in mass to fight against the FO, but they didn't, not even after the destruction of their secret weapon (Starkiller) and a major part of their forces. It's just the resistance and their miniscule ""fleet"" and abysmally small numbers and soldiers who see what the ground tastes like. 

What is the point of a Resistance if there is no real end goal to the resisting when no one actually gave a damn about what the first Rebellion, Luke, Leia, Han, and so many others fought for... Maybe we should just let the FO reign and be content with the fact that the Republic is dead, liberty is gone, resistance is futile, and all our heroes are failures.

"TLDR at bottom

It’s not like a huge annoyance but one of those things that kinda piles up over the movies and takes away from the experience for me. Thinking about the new trilogy, stealing spaceships happens a lot and it’s never really addressed or explained a lot of the time. Here is the list I could think of off the top of my head.

1. TIE Fighter stolen by Finn and Poe. This one makes the most sense thematically and logically. Finn needs a pilot but probably could get them onto the ship with whatever you need to start TIE fighters as he is a member of the first order. Interesting escape ensued, fun times and totally acceptable. Also note that the first order immediately gave chase. 

2. Millennium Falcon stolen by Finn and Rey. This one was the first time I really rolled my eyes at the new movies. And not getting into flying the ship, just the act of stealing it. Like was it just sitting there unlocked, fueled and ready to go? Wouldn’t space ships have some sort of defense system so you couldn’t walk on and just start it up and go? Also if you add in the fact that the Falcon would be well known (probably the only ship to help blow up both Death Stars including physically being the one to blow up the second), wouldn’t it be a prized possession, like a historical artifact almost, not just some piece of junk you leave laying around for someone to steal. It kinda felt like the last action hero when Schwarzenegger could find the keys to any car by looking in the sun visor. But I don’t think it really hurt the movie that much but was an eyebrow raiser for sure. 

3. Resistance ship stolen by Finn and Rose (with Poe’s help?). So before Finn and Rose go on there horrible Las Vegas vacation, they take a ship from the resistance to get there. This is stealing because earlier when Finn tried to escape via escape pod, Rose was given the oh so important task of making sure people didn’t desert the cause. So if they are guarding the fucking escape pods (I mean she was morning her sister but clearly there was standing orders to stop any deserts or something) I’d imagine that actual space ships that can go to warp would have more security to prevent the same thing. It makes some logical sense they could start the ship and maybe fly it (Finn has been established that he is not mechanically inclined so maybe rose knows how to?), and Poe probably had to like convince the guards to look the other way Or something? But wouldn’t they notice a ship missing? Did no one see it leave or detect it leaving with their scanners? It seems like an obstacle that would have been interesting to actually see (instead of say, a pack of alien horses running through town?) This also establishes that ships are now stolen off screen with little effort put into what happened. 

4. Libertine yacht stolen by DJ and BB-88. Like the first entry, this makes a little more sense as of anyone, DJ’s character specializes in this sort of thing and I’m sure some dumb comic goes into it, but it happens entirely off screen. A side note, how did they know where Finn and Rose would be to pick them up? That was lucky considering they didn’t seem to come up with a plan prior to escaping. Whatever, talented splicer with droid that can do anything steal a ship, believable if not very convenient and entirely not explained. 

5. FO shuttle stolen by Finn and Rose. Jesus Finn has be a part of stealing like 5 ships so far. This one is the laziest, their shuttle just shoots out of the main ship after holdos sacrifice. Uh what? I doubt Finn would still be able to get codes to start the shuttle and I imagine more storm troopers would be piling into these to flee the sinking ship or go down to the surface where the rebels are. So like these shuttles just sit around unlocked, fully ready to launch, just waiting for anyone to walk on and go? I mean can you just walk onto an aircraft carrier and hop into a fighter and take off? Wouldn’t a military organization have some sort of protocols for launching spaceships? Again, super convenient and done 100% off screen. But hey at least some fighters gave chase! Which leads us to

6. Supreme Commander Snoke’s escape craft stolen by Rey. I lied last entry, this one is the laziest by far. I mean this isn’t some shuttle or TIE fighter, but the head guys personal craft. What? How? How did she even know this was a thing? How did she get passed any security procedures? Why do we never see this craft? Also remember how I mentioned that the FO gives chase after the other two ships are stolen (numbers 1 and 5), were there no Fighters sent after this? If this was like Air Force One wouldn’t it have its own pilot and crew just in case of emergency, does like joke, sorry Snoke, fly this craft by himself?! Wouldn’t they know something was up if Snoke’s personal ship left and like send guards to the throne room? So many questions and the amount of explanation is one throw-away line. 

7. Salt speeders by the resistance. Ok this one isn’t really “stealing” because I think they said it was an old rebel/resistance base? But it is similar in the idea of ships just magically appearing to serve a plot purpose. It makes kinda sense that they would leave equipment behind and the ships seemed not in great condition but I feel this would be a great spot for a scene like the end of a new hope or beginning of empire with people running around prepping speeders, quick repairs, refueling, pilots getting ready, etc. like establish these speeders and set it all up, build the tension. I only saw TLJ like 1.5 times so maybe this happened but I sincerely can’t remember. Also, this set up scene is where you should of had rose confront Finn about not going out to kill himself and stops him by revealing her feelings. That would make a million times more sense than the speeder crash idea. 


TLDR: So there you have 6 (or 7) times that spaceships, shuttles, space yacht, and fighters have been stolen in the new trilogy and while some of them have made sense (mainly only the first time), the majority are either illogical, happen off screen, seem exceedingly convenient, or are a big missed opportunity for an interesting obstacle. And while these things in themselves don’t make the movies bad, they are like little needles that add up with all the other stuff to lessen my enjoyment of the movies.

"They have already done solo and I think now they should stop, the spinoffs are planned to explain many of he iconic characters in the old trilogy like Obi Wan and Boba Fett, and I honestly don't want them. Everysingle character does not have to be explained fully, I mean, Boba Fett, he is a bounty hunter, he hasn't got a fully explained story because he doesn't need to, you could say he's a pretty mysterious character, his backstory is not that clear, and so tell me why would we need a full movie for his backstory? This can only do more bad than good, an iconic original character potentially ruined with a painful movie spinoff, I really don't think its worth the risk to ruin some of the best movie characters in history.

I personally believe it's better left untold, all that can come out of it is a ruined character, if you don't explain the backstory then you don't have to get hundreds of people disagreeing on how it should've went, it seems to me all the spinoffs are just a moneygrab, because there is simply no need for they're existence. What might interest me however, is maybe a ""Snoke"" spinoff, explaining who Snoke is and how he became so powerful, that would be much better, because TLJ didn't do a good job at that at all, and just killed off his character instead.

Does anyone else agree with me?",I honestly don't really want star wars spinoff movies...,0
"I think the resistance knows they’re in trouble and need alliances. I think we know they go Lando, who probably has knowledge and connections. One key bit of intelligence is the location of a “retired” Admiral Thrawn (Matt Smith). Thrawn has no allegiance to The First Order... in fact, Snoke’s species is a rival to the Chiss Ascendancy in the Outer Rim. The resistance wants to recruit Thrawn, convincing him that the FO is a danger to the Chiss.

Now, this potential storyline would have been a lot more viable if Snoke was still alive, but there possible ways around this. I think Disney wants to keep tying the universe together with familiar characters. Thrawn is a favorite and the latest book shows his alliance is primarily Chiss and he is honorable. 

Of course, Thrawn vs. the FO wouldn’t be fair... he would easily destroy them, so that’s kind of a problem too, unless more of Snoke’s kind show up to be a rival.

In the vein of familiar faces. Is there any reason we may not see Enfys Nest in IX? It seems like she would be the perfect age now to show up. Armor a little more worn and grittier, but maybe a disillusioned.

I’m just throwing out some ideas. There’s nothing that needs to be “wrapped up” quite honestly, so it feels like we need something like familiar characters coming back in and giving a “Dirty Dozen” feel to take on the remnants of the FO and Knights of Ren.",Episode IX Theories,0
"Then it all clicked. 

The mass conspiracy of the Empire to continue along their treacherous path and the illuminating answer to the plaguing questions of who the parents of these remarkable children are.

Star Wars, the clone theory.

Who are Rey's parents? What about Finn? The answer doesn't have to be a furtive affair clandestinely glossed over to not blemish otherwise pristine Jedis. The empire has access to and uses cloning technology to build war machines however they were largely unsuccessful in and of theirselves and only useful as cannon fodder to swarm more powerful enemies in hopes of crushing their foes. Even though they ultimately were successful the next logical step wouldn't be to continue to clone Boba Fett, it would be to clone powerful force users to ensure that each individual member was powerful in their own right. 

Using access to genetic data on hand it would be possible to reproduce great force users throughout history and have an unstoppable army indoctrinated from an early age. However instead of training these individuals to use the force and potentially usurp the mantle of Sith lord they were instead trained as fierce soldiers who would use their latent force abilities unconsciously to ensure their own survival and ultimately the aims of the dark side. It all began with the creation of Anakin. 

After spending half a lifetime attempting to create the most powerful being in the galaxy and claim them as his apprentice Sidious obviously saw the folly of attempting to subvert a force that seemingly had its own will and fickle whims that would supersede any of his strategiery. Why ask the force to create powerful disciples when he could use technology at hand to do so and not have to comb through astronomical expanses of space to find them. Worse yet the arduous process of having to have to reprogram them to his will, a task only made increasingly difficult if they're already diametrically opposed to him. Thats not even taking into account what would happen if this being were to grow more powerful than their creator on their own cognizance and refuse to bow down to an inferior master. 

The only sensible way to create a new disciple that would stand up to the might of Vader would be to tap into the most powerful force user that Sidious knew, one who would make a worthy disciple and had a natural affinity for the dark side of the force. Unbeknownst to anyone while the events of the original saga were occurring a nefarious scheme was taking root that would reverberate through the protagonists lifetimes and beyond.

The pieces are in place.

Something happened between Luke and the Knights of Ren that made him abscond to the nether reaches of space. Was he running away, had he finally given up his lifelong pursuit of justice and peace? Maybe he discovered a nefarious plot and decided to exile himself and his historic midichlorian count to keep it out of the hands of a new sinister overlord. 

Something happened to Snoke that left him horribly disfigured and scarred (seemingly by a white hot light saber). Even then there are so many unanswered questions. Who taught him the ways of the Sith? Why is he such an incredibly strong force user when such people are ostensibly only one out of tens or hundreds of billions? Why does he seem to match descriptions of Darth Plageuis the Wise? How does he have such intimate knowledge of events and details he simply wasn't around for? It just seems like such a Sidious action to clone his mentor to claim as a secret disciple for the inevitability of Vader's demise. It also falls in line with the expected machinations of the Sith Lord. It even stands to reason that after being brought up in the wings the Plagueis clone picked up where his master left off knowing full well of his own lineage and setting off to gather the necessary components to eviscerate the last bastions of the Jedi, even succeeding where his master failed; he would cultivate powerful force users and ensure they were loyal to him to amass an army the likes of which has never been seen. 

Something happened to Rey, who are her parents and why does she have such an indelible and incredibly strong affinity for the force? Why did she only see herself when she went seeking her parents in the dark side cave? Why would someone (presumably Luke) try to hide her on a planet where nobody could find her as opposed to giving her shelter with loved ones as Ben Kenobi did? A Kenobi cut down the first Skywalker, why not try to clone another Kenobi to take out the Skywalker again? If she were a Kenobi then surely Luke sensed it in the force and presumably that's why this small harmless child was singled out to be protected from sinister forces, otherwise why would someone care so much about an unseeming, random child ?

What about Finn? Just some random janitor in a faceless, nameless organization and yet Kylo Ren was fully aware of who he was - almost as if he was keeping tabs on him. How does a lowly janitor get into a lightsaber duel with a Sith master and live to tell the tale? Just like Princess Leia just because force powers aren't bursting forth doesn't mean they're not nascent. Still waters run deep and who else but one of the most renowned light saber duelists in Jedi history to clone in an attempt to fortify your foot soldiers. If this were the case it would be likely they've been tracking FN for a long time but have had doubts about his proclivity to the dark side. When Kylo Ren suddenly turns to him after not participating in the massacre of the first movie was indicative that he was paying particular attention to his actions. More glaringly why would he choose this lowly janitor to accompany him and why would he remember his call sign out of the possibly thousands of soldiers stationed at that very base. Kylo doesn't continue throughout the movie referring to each lowly storm trooper individually. 

The new Star Wars isn't some shoddy rehashing of a formulaic and arcane tale but rather the last vestiges of a cold and ruthless emperor whose cunning is still being felt through the galaxy. ","Wars, the clone theory.",0

"My idea is that in Episode IX, Kylo calls to his grandfather. Vader’s force ghost appears, and as he walks towards Kylo he morphs from the Vader suit to ROTS Anakin, played by Hayden. Somehow through this conversation (where Anakin would try to convince Kylo to the light, tell him to not fall down the same path he did himself) Kylo would reject his fanboyism of his grandfather. 

Now, we know that Kylo’s saber needs two extra blade-ports because they help stabilized his cracked kyber crystal. I believe that the reason he goes through the effort of  using a cracked crystal is because it’s the crystal from Vader’s saber, which was cracked after being destroyed in the destruction of the second Death Star. Kylo would reject this now, as it was a symbol of his obsession over his grandfather. He would somehow end up with the crystal from Rey’s (partially destroyed) saber, and he would bleed it to the dark side (this would look amazing in live-action, IMO). Rey would use Luke’s greensaber to fight Kylo in the climax of the movie, and after defeated him she, alongside the force ghost of Luke (and if we really want to step it up: Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin), would purify it back and it would turn white on the Wellspring of Life, the force planet Yoda visited in TCW that was the source of midichlorians and all life of the galaxy.

The movie would end on Luke, Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda’s force ghosts all together, peacefully watching as the Resistance truly restore order back to the galaxy, and Rey begins training a new generation of Jedi with her purified saber.
I like the idea of the saber being bled and purified because this saber has been through everything, and been wielding by all of the most powerful force-users: Anakin, Kenobi, Rey; Kylo (who bleeds it) then back to Rey as she purifies it on the Wellspring or Life, which I’d love to see. Such a cool concept for a planet that we haven’t seen more of.

" Since Disney took over and the canon changed, we have so many things that are missing details from big to small during the clone wars/prequel era.  I'll keep it simple and ask where does the Clone Wars start for you? While Canon says its with the CGI 2008 show starting with the Episode Cat and Mouse, my concern is thatmany things arent really introduced/explained. For example: Anakins changes, Obi-Wans changes, Grievous, Ventress and more. Its like they were all tossed in and for all of us who know go ""oh yea! I remember you"" but most people who follow whats ""canon"" will still wonder. When did they come into play? I know Star Wars doesnt always need an intro for characters/things, but the 2D 2003 Clone Wars cartoon, while in the later episodes have some continuity issues and is considered no longer canon, had a pretty solid start to the clone wars, introductions, and character changes. It could also easily be considered canon just for the first 21 episodes alone (which is like an hour and 15 total). So I personally feel like that is where it begins.

"Let me see: Order 66 had alredy been issued and carried out; Palpatine had an army and Yoda, the only surviving Jedi Master, didn't have ~~a Hulk~~ any Jedi to fight him back; OTOH, at that point Darth Maul and Darth Dracula were dead so Palpatine would have no Sith disciple nor prospect. The Geonosians had already began building the Death Star and Tarkin was already around. So the Galactic Empire is established just the same, less the Emperor's Force Enforcer, DV. 
  
(Supposedly Anakin lived only because Palpatine Force-siphoned Padme lifeforce to him; if this is to be believed, and he had died, Padme would live, and Luke and Leia wouldn't go to Tatooine and Alderaan; instead they'd be raised in Naboo. Since we never heard about Naboo in the OT is must not be a very influential planet. Just in case, someone cuts Representative Bink's head off so he won't do more damage.)  
    
Without DV around, Palpatine would probably be killed in a plot *à la* Operation Valkyrie, since it's clear he commands more fear than loyalty among the military, but assuming he would be not:  
  
The Battle of Scariff goes just as hard for the rebels but Admiral Squid's ship survives and the DS plans reach the rebel HQ sooner. Tarkin never hears of Yavin. The DS is destroyed before the inauguration at Alderaan.   

The rebels move to Hoth and have a calm winter. Admiral Ozzel never finds them. DV doesn't execute him, but Palpatine does.  
  
DS-2 plan is put in motion. Same result as ROTJ. Palps die.

"Why should we care whether or not the Resistance beats the First Order?

The New Republic was a complete failure, and chose to ignore the First Order threat, and they were destroyed for it.

The Resistance numbered about 400 people *before* they were nearly completely destroyed by the end of The Last Jedi. In the entire galaxy, only 400 people are willing to fight to destroy an objectively evil organization. 400 people. That's about the size of an elementary school.

A major theme in TLJ is how there isn't really ""good"" and ""bad"". ""Good guys, bad guys...Made-up words. Let's see who formally owns this gorgeous hunk. This guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh, and the good ones. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join."" The Jedi, the guardians of peace for thousands of years, are treated as abject failures.

There are no allies of the Resistance. Leia says she has allies, but none of them choose to help. Nobody in the galaxy cares whether or not the First Order takes over or not.

""Balance of the Force"" is reconned to mean equal parts light/dark, meaning that the conflict will never end.

So why should we, the audience, care? ",Why should we care if the Resistance wins?,0

"I'm not even sure if I can talk about this here or not. I just wanted to take a minute to talk about my son, moderators may delete if they see fit. This is related to Star Wars in a way, so read to the end.

Crying as I type this, last year around this time I began heading down a path that I am neither proud of, condone, nor would I ever go down this path again; I won't say what. Shortly after this journey of mine began (four months or so), my girlfriend of eight years finds out that she's pregnant. She'd spent most of her adult life thinking that she was unable to conceive, not wanting children this didn't bother her much.  But finding out she was going to be a mother made her the happiest I'd seen in quite some time. At first we were hoping for a girl, we even had a name picked out, Eevee Rose. But we found out early on that we were having a boy.

​

We thought hard about a name and she kept suggesting Kai (taken from the TV show Lexx). I liked it, but I wasn't sold on the idea that we name our son Kai. At this point he'd already been through hell, so I knew he was a strong one (more on that later). A few days passed and out of the blue it hits me, Ky-ber. She could still call him Ky for short and I get to name my son after something Star Wars. I threw the idea out and she wasn't quite sold on the idea until I explained a few things. You see at this point, maybe five months in and he had already survived so much. He survived the morning after pill, a sub-chorionic bleed out and a miscarriage scare. I told her that I wanted to name him Kyber for two reasons, kyber crystals are strong (and this kid was strong, I knew it from the moment I heard his heart beat), and kyber crystals are the most precious thing in the universe to a Jedi, same as my son to me.

​

So here I sit, no longer the monster that I was becoming thanks to my son, Kyber Duran.

"So here's my little rant here if you care to read it.  Enjoy it, tell me to go fuck myself, post your opinions down below

By that I'm referring to the moral grey area that the Jedi Order was painted in in the movie and the other grey and more serious themes they introduce not so subtley into the movie that resonate with real life (like the military industrial complex thing).  I'm not opposed to the idea that the Jedi may be a little in the grey area morally, there is a lot of arguments you could make for this but this isn't something I want to hear about in a Star Wars movie this is stuff that should be very subtle and left to fan interpretation not overly stated.

Its all part of the wave of postmodernism that has infected everything.  I'm not even against postmodernism because there's a lot of truth in it.  A lot the time things are not what they seem, things a lot more relative than we think, and often times the bad guys aren't as bad as we think and the good guys aren't as good.  In REAL LIFE things are pretty grey.  BUT THIS IS A FUCKING STAR WARS MOVIE I watch a Star Wars movie to get away from real life I don't want to think about how in real life things are more complicated and greyer and not as simple.  This is fucking star wars I want a cool space adventure movie where we know who the good guys are and we know who the bad guys are.  I want a simple tale of good vs evil, and blah blah blah.  Pretty soon itll turn out that the Predator hunts because its the only way it can feed its species, or its species is held hostage and forced into it like no dude the Predator is a fucking badass Hunter who don't give two shits about your life and is going to cut your head off and rip your fucking spine out!

&amp;#x200B;

Call me a nostalgic fuck but I miss 20 years ago when it was okay to have a simple movie about good vs. evil.  Like don't get me wrong I really like complex stories that show how morally grey life often is, ""subvert our expectations"", question our perception of reality, question if there even is a right or wrong.  Things like Rick and Morty, American Psycho, Taxi Driver, 2001 Space Oddysey, A Clockwork Orange these all are fucking great movies with fascinating philosophical questions that make you ponder a lot of stuff.  BUT I DON'T WANT THAT IN FUCKING STAR WARS.  This is WORLD WAR 2 IN SPACE WHERE THE BRAVE FREEDOM FIGHTERS FIGHT THE EVIL NAZIS.  If you want to have some morally grey stuff that's fine, but don't have Luke Skywalker blatantly say it.  Make it subtle.  Surprisingly George Lucas actually does a decent job of it in the prequels.  You never think about it when you see it, but when you rewatch it for the fifth time you actually wonder how much better are the Jedi than the Sith in all reality? Were the Separatists the good guys? Who'da thought George Lucas could do subtlety.",The Last Jedi's moral grey area in Wars thing,0
"I just rewatched for the first time since seeing it a few times in theaters (thank you Netflix). Now that most of the [dust](https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/324/171/cc1.gif) of criticism has settled I wanted to watch and try to see how I felt it fit in objectively within the context of all the Star Wars movies. I realized pretty quickly that it's actually really hard to do that without the final movie of the trilogy existing yet. 


Think about all the other Star Wars movies that have been reshaped and made better by the movies that came out after them. To me, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones would be nothing without Revenge of the Sith which ties that trilogy together and makes all of the movies better and more worthwhile. I didn't live through it but I'm sure Empire is even better if you know the conclusion it's leading up to in Return of the Jedi. Not to mention the entire OT holds so much more weight thanks to the Prequels and Rogue one.


My point is- I think people are over-eager to dislike The Last Jedi and should reserve some judgement until the trilogy wraps up. Are there issues with it? Sure. Can a strong conclusion make a lot of them non-issues or even advantages? Definitely. 


Maybe a bit more controversial: I would argue that Rian Johnson set it up perfectly for IX to do just that. He gave characters flaws that made them hard to like but if JJ gives them great redemptions then we'll learn to appreciate their struggles in TLJ instead of be frustrated by them.


tl;dr: Patience, you must have. If you hate TLJ now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.

"Basically this is a ""how i would have done it"" so bear with me if you will. Right off the bat my first change is Luke being still connected to the force. He's still on his little island but he's in a different state mentally. Instead of having decided to completely cut himself off from the galaxy he's arrived at another unhealthy extreme where he's obsessively devoted himself to finding a way to redeem Ben.

 Having pulled his father back to the light, surely the great Luke Skywalker could do the same for poor little innocent and frightened Ben Solo now right? The problem here is that it's not like Ben can't be redeemed, it's that he doesn't want to. We've seen his conflict many times after all, he is still capable of good but he is doing everythinh in his power to beat it out of himself. With Vader he was carefully manipulated tricked, seduced and betrayed into the Dark Side. He didn't ask for it but after everything that happened to him it came naturally to him so he assumed the role willingly, it suited him after all. Ben actively sought out the Dark Side out of his misplaced admiration for his grandfather and it is what drove him to Snoke.

 Speaking of him let's get back on track. Luke becomes obsessed with learning about Snoke (sound fammiliar). In my version he's looking for the first Jedi Temple because he believes Snoke found it first and the secrets he uncovered there allowed him to ammas his power and corrupt Ben Solo's mind. He becomes so narrow minded about it that he nearly convincess himself he's not full of shit and he's not just running away from his guilt and from facing his friends. Luke's biggest fear is letting people down and we get to see that fear consume him while he's trying to run away from it. Maybe his fear of dissapointing others is why he's reluctant to train Rey in my version. 

Luke's flaw in this film, much like ours, is that his focus isn't where it sould be. He's so obssessed with Snoke and redeeming Ben that he forgets to truly look at and see his own nephew. Blinded by his love for the boy he convincess himself that he must be on this path because of Snoke's influence. What we learn though is that Ben is the one who sought out Snoke in search of guidence but he was reluctant to fully commit untill that incident with Luke pulling out his lightsaber on him(that one stays as it was). That also aligns with Ben's overall struggle with himself and the pull of the light which only fuels Luke's missguided attempts to save him. 

The reason why Luke can't face his fear is because in order to do so he would have to give up somethig of immense value in return. He would have to admit to himself that not everyone can be saved regardless of circumstancess. A classic case of his greatest strength being his biggest weakness as well. I believe it's much more interesting to challenge a character like that on something they believe they know and have them reevaluate it, rather than trying to teach them something new. Handling failure is a leason that was drilled into Luke way back in Empire so it doesn't make sense to me to have him relearn it here as well. In my version he is trying to deal with his failure but he is going about it the wrong way and has to correct himself. So, what do you guys think? 

P.S. Whether he lives or dies im still not sure. Im leaning toward lives though because i don't think a single movie is enough for that kind of arc. Plus with all the other stuff happening (im not up to the task of rewriting the whole movie just yet) it'll be far too packed. ",My personal version of Luke's arc in The Last Jedi.,0

"I thought it would be fun to pitch and cast your own Star Wars movie. Pick a director, a cast, and of course, a general outline/synopsis. 

I am choosing a loose adaptation of James Luceno's Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader. 

Here is the original plot of that novel, as per Wookieepedia: 

Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader begins in the final hours of the Clone Wars, just before the implementation of Order 66 as depicted in Revenge of the Sith. When a contingent of clone troopers on the planet Murkhana refuses to open fire on Jedi Masters Roan Shryne and Bol Chatak, along with Padawan Olee Starstone, the Jedi with whom it has fought alongside during the war, Emperor Palpatine orders Vader to investigate the matter. Vader's query soon becomes a hunt for the fugitive Jedi, and takes him back to Coruscant, and from there on to Alderaan and Kashyyyk. During the course of Vader's search the whereabouts of several characters from Episode III, including Bail Organa, R2-D2 and C-3PO, Chewbacca, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, are revealed. The beginnings of Vader's partnership with Grand Moff Tarkin are also shown. 
Luceno devotes much of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader to the internal conflict that Darth Vader undergoes as he tries to shed his former identity of Anakin Skywalker and relearn to master the Force. Palpatine intends for these early missions that he sends Vader on to be as much about learning what it means to be a Sith as they are about consolidating the rule of the nascent Empire.

The final chapters of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader depict the beginning of the Imperial enslavement of the Wookiees of Kashyyyk, an act that will eventually lead to the partnership between Han Solo and Chewbacca.

The novel ends with Obi-Wan Kenobi learning of Vader's survival after their duel on Mustafar (depicted in Revenge of the Sith). Fearing for safety of the infant Luke Skywalker whom he is watching over, he communes with the spirit of his late master Qui-Gon Jinn, who tells him that Luke will grow to confront his father when the time is right and that Darth Vader will never return to Tatooine; as Qui-Gon explains, the planet is the whole of everything that was Anakin Skywalker, someone Vader wants to forget forever.

It is revealed that the general public of the galaxy believes that Anakin Skywalker perished in the attack on the Jedi Temple (which Skywalker led as Darth Vader).

I remember reading this novel the week it came out and I was absolutely enthralled with it. It is definitely one of the highlights of the old expanded universe. It is an excellent character study on Darth Vader and his internal conflicts shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith. However, I feel like a lot of the internalized plot points that the author touches on would be very difficult to convey on screen. We all know that there are things in novels that just do not work when translated to the silver screen. There is so much more detail and novels. And all of that stuff would be lost when trying to do it on the screen. I also would love to change the timeline and make it further away from order 66. It needs to be about a year or two after the events of episode three. 

First of all considering that Vader is always wearing his helmet, you can't really delve too deeply into his expressions and his emotions in a compelling way. The only way to make these kind of scenes work is when Vader is alone, meditating, in his chambers. And you can use flashbacks/force backs to convey his pain and regret. I have not spent a lot of time thinking about what I would change exactly. This post is something I came up with this morning, I'm just sitting around being bored.

The Jedi characters we will be following are not characters that we have spent considerable time with before. And the same can be said of the bounty hunter characters that I would like to introduce. I have not spent much time at all thinking about how I would adapt this story. All I know is that I think it would be one of the very best standalone stories that could be done. Everyone seems to be obsessed with the idea of a Kenobi character study, and I think one on Vader would be just as compelling. The Skywalker saga is the story of Anakin, and experiencing his grieving of Padme and his betrayal of the Jedi is the biggest potential of any standalone story, to me. 

My pick for director is Zack Snyder!!!

Give Snyder 7 Jedi in hiding. One Master. 3 Knights. 2 Padawans. 1 Youngling. Vader hires bounty hunters to give the Empire intel on potential Jedi still out there. Set it on a backwater planet that was once a Republic stronghold.

Jedi Padawans played by Ray Fisher and Jena Malone 

Jedi Youngling played by Jacob Tremblay

"Let's assume that a redeemed Vader had survived the Death Star finale of RotJ, and lived long enough to compose an account of his life. Let's also assume he was powerful with a pen in his hand. How do you think he might write it?

Some of my favourite novels are written through the first person narrative, and I enjoy stories told as a series of diary entries, so as a Star Wars fan it's a question I love to ponder. The storytelling in the 6 films is omniscient as much as possible, and while I've no complaints with that, I feel the personal reflection of a key character would greatly compliment the lore. 

It would be fascinating to read Anakin's own words - after a long career fighting for Darth Sidious, which his son eventually liberated him from, he is bound to have a lot to say about that faithful period on Coruscant when he turned.

He could argue that he had revenge on Palpatine when he threw him off the Death Star in VI, but as a redeemed Jedi master I assume he would be beyond petty feelings of vengeance. This is, after all, a man who did many despicable things, and the regret from this would surely outweigh any jubilation from overthrowing an Emperor, as fundamental as that act was to the galaxy.

It's quite poetic that though it was family that helped Anakin plunge into darkness, it was also what helped free him. The former as utter tragedy, the latter as atonement. Whenever I watch the scene where Vader looks on at Sidious torturing Luke, I can't help but think of all the issues that must have been going through his head. I like to think that it was here Anakin realised Sidious was complicit in his wife's death, and would not let it repeat with his son.

Anakin would surely have a lot to write about the short, albeit happy, 3 years he spent as a loving husband. It would undoubtedly be more mature that what we see depicted on screen in AotC, but as touching as the best scenes from RotS. At face value Star Wars is exactly that, battles in space, but behind it lies human relationships: the brotherhood between Anakin and Obi-Wan, the romance between Anakin and Padmé. A memoir might lean a little too heavy on the human aspect for action fans, but it would be for the better.",[general discussion] The memoirs of Anakin Skywalker,0

"""I didn't want a Han Solo movie, I wanted an Obi-Wan movie!"" This was a line from a person I met at a party the other day. She went on in great detail about what the film could be about, a more character focused, philosophical, space western of sorts. 

Now I'm not saying this friend was wrong for thinking this or that any of you are wrong for thinking this either.

What I think is questionable is this notion that a supposed Obi-Wan, should one ever get made, make Black Panther levels of box office. I think it would do better than Solo but not by much I feel.

It sits in the same category of ""unwarranted, this only appeals to the fans, answers a bunch of trivia."" The general audience really doesn't care for stuff like this hence the ""success"" of Solo was largely came from the fans. And the fans are never enough to keep a franchise going. 

Who is realistically, outside of the fans, going to pay for a ticket to see Obi-Wan do things for two hours? I like Ewan McGreggor as Obi-Wan but that is not enough to warrant an entire film about it.

You don't have to like TFA or TLJ but they did well for being simple, straight forward films that embraced diversity and welcomed new audiences all around.

But what do I know, maybe if the film ever does get made it will be crazy successful and this post will be dated.

"I was talking to another friend of mine who is also a huge Star Wars fan about carbon freezing. One question I had during our discussion is whether Han still had some brain activity while frozen. For example, could he dream while he was in hibernation, or was it like a complete comatose state? If he had cognitive activity, to what extent?  


Also, would the length you are frozen affect you when you were thawed? Obviously we know that you have hibernation sickness, but my friend thought that the effects of hibernation sickness would get much more damaging the longer a person is frozen. Would hibernation sickness get significantly worse the longer someone is frozen, potentially causing permanent damage? Or would the effect largely be the same regardless of how long you are frozen, with a person just recovering quicker if they are frozen for a shorter length?   


The Wookiepedia entry on carbonite is surprisingly slim, which is part of why I decided to ask you all if you had any more information about carbon freezing.

"It seems like for every Star Wars film, there's someone who's going to find plenty to criticize it. Prequels, sequels and originals alike. They might find them boring. They might find them written badly. They might dislike the special effects or the action or the acting. Whatever the case is, I think we can all agree that opinions on each film *hugely* vary.

Now, for the games on the other hand, aside from EA's stuff, Kinect Star Wars and *maybe* The Force Unleashed, I've not seen much negativity. Granted, I'm talking about the *big* games. Not the small ones that nobody even knows exist. I'm talking stuff like Knights of the Old Republic, the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games, Jedi Academy, Republic Commando, Rogue Squadron, classic Battlefront, Empire at War, Podracing, even the Lego games. They're *almost* in a universally positive light. Granted, I'm aware that their audiences are far smaller than the film audiences, so it's kind of a ""No shit"" that there would be fewer vocal opinions, but still.

Knights of the Old Republic is deemed by many as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.

X-Wing and TIE Fighter are praised for their ability to put players in the perspective of a pilot with deep gameplay.

Republic Commando is praised for its focus on its squad-based gameplay.

Jedi Academy is praised for its lightsaber combat.

"Seems like not. In Episode I Qui-gon and Obi-Wan demonstrate this power, and in the (thankfully non-canon) Clone Wars mini-series it showed up a few times (along with a ton of other stylistically cool but ridiculously flashy and OP force powers), and of course several video games had it, but since then it seems to have been dropped, even when it would be really convenient for Jedi characters to use.

So I guess it's retconned? I mean it makes sense; super speed is one of the most OP super-powers ever, and you have to maintain some tension for Jedi since they shouldn't be as gods. Are you comfortable calling it a retcon or do you think it's some kind of lost knowledge from long ago?","So, can Jedi run super fast or not?",0

"I was hesitant to buy this since I already have the Blu Ray versions of the films, and the only upside was the fact that I can watch them anywhere. But for $100 that didn’t seem worth it. I tried to look at reviews and such to see if there were any perks. Once I saw that they had the legacy content as well as all the other features, I thought why not get it as it would be a great place to have everything in one location. I was very satisfied with my purchase for a couple of reasons:

The Collection: where on the blu rays you navigate the figures yourself, these come in one video that is much more efficient and convenient in my opinion and gives me more incentive to look at and appreciate them.

The legacy content is built in so you don’t have to pull out the old dvds or look for them on YouTube.

Finally, the biggest surprise of them all is the Conversations. These are tremendous pieces of Star Wars history and insight that we haven’t seen before. Sure we have heard from the big names all the time in the documentaries or other features, but these are conversations with the people behind the scenes in the film industry and I found that they were hidden gems of content I didn’t know I needed.

Even though I have watched these movies and features countless times, this collection revitalized my love for Star Wars again and reminded me of the joy and love that Star Wars gave to me. Thank you for reading and may the force be with you.

"Anakin was a young kid who grew up in slavery, left his mother behind and ventured into a giant galaxy. He was a kid the entire time, or young adult by ROTS.

"Hi folks, I know I know, another one of these posts. This is mostly legends too, anyways.............

After doing some general research about The Old Republic (MMORPG not organization) I feel like technology slowly stagnated after some 3000 years and it finally hit its low point at the time of the Galactic Empire. All of the Sith Lords have this technologically advanced armor with pipes and lights and stuff all over it from Jadus’s mask to Kallous’s whatever. I’d even say the Eternal Empire is even more advanced and after that it just all goes away. The Sith are there but by Bane and Kaan’s time they aren’t nearly as advanced as the old empire. Later on after the republic demilitarized that’s when the stagnation really began because there was no military to advance anything. Fast forward and I’d say the Clone War brought the galaxy out of stagnation with both sides advancing AI technology and clone trooper armor. But as soon as the Empire reigns it all goes away.  The armor sucks, the weapons suck, the star fighters are terrible, every Imperial project fails, and arguably the ISD might be one of the worst designed ships I’ve ever seen. Barely any fighters, no point defense, exposed shields, etc.  Even after the Empire fell technology kinda stayed the same for the next 120-138 years.",Technological Stagnation in the Galaxy,0

"Hi everyone, I spent some time writing an alternate story for Episode III and I was wondering if anyone would have any interest in it. It's still very much in an outline form, but this is a summary below. If there's interest I'll flesh it out and write it.

*Anakin Skywalker discovers that the Sith have infiltrated the Jedi council. Palpatine was just a decoy for the real attack. Darth Sidious has been secretly hiding within the Jedi masters the entire time, weakening the Jedi, influencing their decisions to ones which would alienate them from the Republic.*

*Anakin rushes to The Works to stop Sidious from enacting his final plan, which would wipe out the Jedi and bring rise to a Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan Kenobi learns the truth too late to stop Anakin from rushing in alone. The Jedi temple is under attack from the Republic, there is not much time, the Jedi are spread too thin. This all happened too fast.*

*Anakin walks into the hot manufacturing plant as the monster, masquerading as the Jedi master he had admired for years, turns to face him and smiles. Darth Sidious activates the security locks in the room, trapping one with the other. There is a brief silence as they gaze at one another before Anakin unsheathes his lightsaber and charges at the Sith Lord. Their battle begins as Obi-Wan arrives too late and looks on helplessly through a force field door, just as he had years prior. Red and blue lightsabers strike through the heated air as laughter begins to circulate the room. Sidious doesn’t say a word. As the lightsabers crackle against each other, the room begins to lose its focus... Anakin knows he has to win. He cannot let Sidious live. Fear of what would happen to Padme flows through his mind. Fear of what would happen to those he cared about. Each strike with a lightsaber is more violent then the last.*

*Sidious reaches out and taps into Anakin’s fear and clouds his mind. Anakin begins to feel his mind being pulled away and thoughts begin to take hold that exist in the darkest corner of his soul. Sidious is too powerful. Anakin thinks about the things in the Jedi order which he disagreed with. Pieces he could not reconcile. The children taken from their parents to become soldiers. The lack of justice for those who needed it. The bureaucracy stopping them from protecting the weak*.......***No justice.... They were afraid of him.... Pushed him to the side.... Kept him at an arms distance because of his dissenting views...*** *Anakin can feel himself losing his mind. He keeps fighting it until he sees behind the red lightsaber is no longer Sidious, but his brother, Obi-Wan Kenobi.*

*Sidious found a way into Anakin’s mind through his fear and has begun destroying him from the inside out. Anakin fights the figure of Kenobi to a drop off area where there is burning hot metal twenty feet below them. Sidious has been toying with him, as his force mind control has been clouding his vision, and in the guise of Obi-Wan, disarms Anakin and cuts off his legs and arm and allows him to fall to the burning hot metal, as Obi-Wan screams from behind a soundless door.*

*The Sith lord picks up Anakins burned wreckage as he activates the final piece of his plan and the building starts falling apart around them. His body and his mind destroyed. Obi-Wan watches helplessly as they fly away.*

*-------*

*Obi-Wan is attempting to escape with the younglings on the republics ship when he is confronted by Darth Vader. Obi-Wan knows immediately who is behind the armour. He can feel him. Obi-Wan momentarily cannot speak, and refuses to fight. He calls out for his brother. Vader unsheathes his lightsabre and attacks Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan pleads with him, refusing to strike back, only defending the blows. He doesn't realize that Anakin Skywalker is gone, only Darth Vader remains.*

*Vader finally understood it was the Jedi who were destroying the galaxy. Who were stealing children. Who were building an army to take over the galaxy and protect only who they saw fit. Vader can now bring order. He can deliver justice. He can give power to the weak. The Jedi were a cancer. They used the excuse of their self made bureaucracy and allowed the deaths of millions who begged for life. The Jedi could not protect Padme, could not protect his child, and they need to be destroyed for order and justice to be restored to the galaxy.*

*“This is not you Anakin. The Sith Lord has poisoned your mind, destroyed your thoughts. It is not too late! Please...Anakin come with me.”*

*“It is far too late, Jedi.”*

*As the dock doors began closing on the escape pod housing the younglings, Darth Vader uses the force and violently tears the pod off his ship before the doors can seal. There is a loud cry, and then silence. Obi-Wan screams. He helplessly reaches out to the children he vowed to protect, as they float lifelessly in space. Obi-Wan finally sees that this is no longer is brother, there is no longer an Anakin Skywalker. There is only Darth Vader. And he engages in battle with no words. There is no gracefulness to this fight, there is no dance. There is only pain, only loss, only the death of a family as each lightsaber blade hits and hits.*

*Vader is too powerful and Obi-Wan too weak from the fighting that led to this moment. They both know the end is near. Obi-Wan directs the fight near the closest escape pod.*

*---*

*As Obi-Wan flies away on the escape pod, he slowly begins to break down. First just tears begin to fall down his face, until he can hold it in no more, and starts screaming as the pod flies through the empty vacuum of space.*",My Rewrite of Episode III (Still mostly outline),0

All Lucas employees were given a choice to see Episode III at one of four theaters around the bay area. We chose Lowes because it was the only one with a digital display. What a lucky pick that turned out to be!

We got to San Francisco around 6:20 a.m. Parked the car, and got straight in line outside. We were about 20th or so. The doors weren't going to open until around 9 a.m., so we had some waiting to do. Those three hours however went by faster than you could imagine. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and to be that immersed with fellow fans and people who work for ILM and Lucasfilm was purely amazing. Ryan Church, and his team of artists that did all of the designs and art for Revenge of the Sith were right ahead of us in line. I talked to him a little bit about what it was like seeing the things he drew 3 years ago being put up on the big screen and being bought by guys like me in toy stores around the world. His answer is what you would imagine, he said it was ""just amazing.""

We all played Star Wars trivial pursuit for about an hour until around 8:45 a.m. when someone right behind us said ""have you looked at how big the line is lately?"" So I stepped out of line and looked all the way down the street. There were over 1500 people in line waiting to see the employee screening of the film! And these were people who actually worked on the film! I was #20 or so, and the guy who was the principal of photography must have been #1248! That's crazy! How did I get so lucky?!? I thanked God right there! People who have worked for George their entire lives were walking all the way to the end of the line. Hey, the handout they gave all of us said specifically ""No saving places in line, or seats.""

9 a.m. finally rolls around and the line starts to move inside the theater. They grabbed that green ticket that you can see above the first paragraph and off we went. The only theater in the entire building that was playing the movie digitally was theater number 15. So walking as fast as I possibly could without getting in trouble for running, I made it to theater 15. To my amazement, no one was sitting in the middle rows yet, so I hopped right in and sat down. As soon as my butt hit the seat, one of the ushers said ""Excuse me sir you can't sit there."" I said ""Excuse me? I've been in line since 6:30. I think we should be able to sit wherever we want!"" Nicely, but firmly the usher quipped back, ""Sorry sir, those seats are for George and his family"".
The usher didn't need to say anything else. I knew exactly who George was before she even finished that sentence. George Lucas was going to be watching Episode III with all of us. Whoa. I needed a seat after hearing that. So I climbed up about 4 rows where the seats weren't reserved anymore and sat down.

About 15 minutes passed and I got to talking to the girl next to me. Her name was Maggie. She works at ILM. Right in the middle of one of her sentences she says ""Oh my God, there's Robin Williams!"" And sure enough, grabbing his seat 3 rows ahead of us was Mork himself. I guess he was trying to be inconspicuous and go low-profile, because he was wearing the brightest orange shirt I've ever seen.

A few minutes passed and out of my right I see a gray haired guy in the same row as Robin Williams talking to a few people. It was the man. For the first time in my life, not only was I in the same room as George Lucas, but I was actually looking at him in real life, not via my tv. Time stood still for a few moments. Somewhere, God was smiling for me. I don't know how George slipped in without thunderous applause, but somehow he did. I was waiting for people to start whispering and then go into thunderous applause, but it never happened. George just shook hands and hugged the people around him, and then went over about 8 chairs to sit next to Robin Williams for about 10 minutes.

I would have loved to have heard what they were saying, because every 30 seconds or so, they both started laughing out loud. I'm sure Robin Williams was being his usual self, but I can count the times on two fingers that I've seen George Lucas laugh. He is always very serious and diplomatic when he gives interviews, so it was candid to see him relaxed and jovial. I really wish I could have been able to hear them, but seeing it was pretty neat too.

After George went back to his seat and settled in, the lights dimmed. Everyone cheered before anything was even shown on the screen. They showed a 10 second Digital Screen promo and then BOOM, right into the 20th Century Fox logo. Applause. Lucasfilm logo. Thunderous ovation. STAR WARS. Louder than any movie theater cheer I have ever heard or been a part of. Now I'm not going to describe how great the movie was, or anything about it. I'm sure you can read one of any number of reviews on the internet right now. Like I said, it delivered. This is the movie that Star Wars fans have been waiting for since 1983 since Return of the Jedi.

As I watched the film in awe, not really comprehending that I was actually sitting in the same theater with George Lucas, Robin Williams, Rick McCallum, the art dept, etc etc, I couldn't help from doing something from time to time. I found myself every 10 or 15 minutes looking a few rows ahead of me at George watching to see his reaction to his own creation. Granted I couldn't see his facial expressions, but he was just as into it as the rest of us. Applauding when the rest of us applauded, laughing at the jokes that he undoubltedly wrote himself. Surreal is all I can say. I get goose bumps just writing about it right now. At one point during the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight, he leaned to the person on his left and whispered something in his ear. As much as I wished I could hear what he and Robin Williams were talking about, I would have given just about anything to hear his own commentary on his film. Sure, you can hear his commentary on the DVD when you buy it 6 months from now, but that's not the same as when it's all fresh in his head and he is not being interviewed or otherwise recorded for future reference. I bet he was saying things that he'll never repeat again.

After the final scene, the blue font credits appeared. George's name was first. My friend and I were the first and only people to stand up and start cheering. Everyone else remained seated while they applauded. And that's the difference between myself and every other Star Wars fan. I love these films. They are a part of me. Standing up to thank the man who was responsible for it all was a natural reaction. I'm also proud to say that I was the only person who yelled ""THANK YOU GEORGE!!"" as I applauded. The clapping went on throughout the entire credits. It would get louder as the people who were in attendance names appeared on screen. You'd hear a section in the lower left corner cheer really loud as someones name came on, and other parts of the theater as well when other names appeared. Not one person left during the credits. Not one person. After the final credits rolled, and the lights came on, everyone finally stood up and looked at George. The whole theater knew where he was sitting. We all turned to him and clapped for at least another 2 minutes. Finally, when we had stopped, George said something. ""Thank you everyone, without you all, this wouldn't have been possible."" And to that I say, No George, thank you. Without you, none of this would have ever happened in the first place.

After the movie, all four theaters that the film was shown at throughout the bay area converged at the new site for Lucasfilm, ILM and Lucasarts, at the Presidio. We had lunch inside the building which was decorated with 20 foot posters from the film, and many of the costumes and props as well. At one point, right before I left, George Lucas was standing around 3 or 4 people. He wasn't really talking to them, as he seemed to be just taking it all in. I realized I was staring at a once in a lifetime moment. So I walked up to him, put my hand on his back and said ""George, my name is Ricky Borba and I just wanted to say thank you for Star Wars. You have no idea what it means to me."" After I finished my sentence, George extended his hand out towards mine, I grabbed it and we shook hands. He said ""Ricky, it's my pleasure.""

And I believe him. He loves Star Wars just as much as I do. ","I watched Revenge of the Sith with George Lucas in 2005, two weeks before it came out. My blog post went viral before viral was a thing...",0

"Now let me explain my stupidity, I'm more of a new fan, at least I wasn't an SW fan until 2013. I really didn't like prequels when I first watched them. I'm still not fan of dialogues and overuse of CGI, but I came to love these movies in their own way.

It's just incredible how much of prequels I have misinterpreted and how many details I have missed. Some of the examples:

- The biggest thing I misinterpreted, was the fact that movies were clearly showing flaws of the Jedi and the fact that those flaws were what lead to their downfall. I thought that trilogy was actually trying to show Jedi as super duper good guys, while Siths were super duper bad. 

- I found myself surprisingly rooting for Anakin in many cases, while on my first watch I was getting angry at him. Like on how council treats him, even though he was serving for them for years now. How terrible some of their teachings and advices were

- I also loved the little detail that Jedi think Anakin is too old. I interpreted as a showcase of how Jedi want to indoctrinate children rather than truly explaining them their ideologies and such. 

- The fact that Obi Wan says that if Qui Gon was more obedient, he would've been part of a council. Another scene that shows how Jedi are afraid of different opinions. Also, Qui Gon was probably the wisest character in prequels.

- The terrible ""lack of attachment"" rule, which I hated at first thinking of how dumb it is that ""good guys"" have this rule, but now I realize that it is another way of showing how much flawed Jedi were and how insecure they were about their ideology. One of my especially favorite scenes is where Anakin in desperation comes to Yoda for advice on how to save Padme, yet he can't reveal anything because of this rule. Yoda on the other hand gives him horrendous advice, tells him to let it go, how tf is he going to let his pregnant wife go? 

- Obi Wan pulling his lightsaber first instead of trying to talk to Anakin and leaving him there to burn. At first I thought it was inconsistent with the originals, because Jedi were usually the last to pull it out, but now I see that it was intentional, showing how Obi Wan let his anger take over. 

- I still don't like Yoda bouncing off ridiculously, but I love how him having a lightsaber in prequels and not having them in originals subtly shows his development and how he changed. 
 
There are so much more, it will take ages to write. Just wanted to share the fact that I came to appreciate these movies. It's really sad what happened to Jake Lloyd. 

Hayden Christensen also got lots of undeserved hatred, even though I thought he was pretty good, especially in ROTS (the scene in council room where he looks at Padme through a window was especially very well acted). YES, there were scenes where he was cringey, but I don't think you could act out those lines better lol. It's really sad that he doesn't get much roles anymore, before SW came out, he even got an Golden Globes and Screen Guild Awards nominations for his role in Life as a House. Guy was getting somewhere, but role that was supposed to give him a boost, instead took everything. ",So I rewatched prequels for the first time!!!!! (TLDR),0

"This is a character who wants power for power's sake.  He is actively trying to rid himself of whatever light is within him.  He's not like Vader, who fell to the dark side because he thought the power could help him save his loved ones.  No.  Kylo doesn't care about the people who should be his ""loved ones.""  He rather sees them as rivals who need to be overcome/surpassed.

This is why I find him so fascinating.  He's understandable without being sympathetic.  He comes from a lineage of powerful and important people.  His family changed the course of galactic history.  The life of a regular Jedi would be insufficient for someone like him.  He needs to fulfill the potential of his bloodline.  And that's what he thinks he's doing.

We're talking about the grandson of Darth Vader.  The nephew of Luke Skywalker.  The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa.  His grandfather was the iron fist of the Galactic Empire.  The Sith who destroyed the Jedi Order.  His uncle was the Jedi who brought down Darth Sidious's tyrannical regime.  His father was the infamous smuggler and heroic Rebellion general who helped destroy both Death Stars.  And his mother was the Princess of Alderaan.  The face of the Rebel Alliance.  And one of the most influential leaders of the New Republic.

I can see why he'd feel like it was his destiny to rule the galaxy.  It's one of the only things left for a Skywalker to accomplish.  The family that was born of the Force into slavery and rose to become the most powerful family in galactic history.  He his the apex of his bloodline.

Does this mean he can't be redeemed?  No.  But should he be?  I'm not so sure.  The Skywalker name can live on without him.  Luke is now an eternal Force ghost.  Rey can take on the Skywalker name for herself.  The galaxy doesn't NEED their bloodline.

And let's be real here:  The primary reason people want him redeemed is so the Skywalker bloodline can continue.  But in and of itself, that's not a good ""narrative reason"" why he should be redeemed.

EDIT:  I see a lot of people claiming that Kylo Ren cares about his mom and Rey.  While it's true that he INITIALLY couldn't fire at his mother towards the beginning of TLJ, he's ready to mercilessly slaughter her and the rest of the Resistance at the end of the film.  And that includes Rey.  ""I'll destroy her and you and all of it.""  That's him rejecting ANYONE who cares about him.",I don't understand the notion that Kylo Ren needs/deserves redemption.,0

"In terms of how it operates in the story, I mean. A lot of people seem to misunderstand Star Wars to a degree and see the darkside as just a set of powers and Balance as lining up that set of powers with ""light"" aligned powers. But that's not what the darkside truly is. The darkside is literally best personified as evil itself, the darkside is called such not because of the power but the usage and intent, the darkside is using the force for evil. 

One argument I saw someone else on Reddit use is that the Darkside is best understood as being like the One Ring in Lord of the Rings. Asking why Luke, Rey, or any other Force user can't just use the darkside without turning evil is like asking why Aragorn or Frodo can't just claim the ring to defeat Sauron. Doing that goes against inherent properties of the thing they're trying to use, just as the Ring always corrodes the user and will always obey the Will of Sauron, the Darkside always corrupts the user and always warps whatever good intentions they might have. Just like the only choice for Aragorn or Frodo was to refuse the Ring's temptation and refuse to wear it, the only choice for a Jedi is to refuse the darkside, the call to selfish desire.",Would you say that the Darkside is best compared to the One Ring of power?,0

"I've not really commented or tried arguing with people here for a while because I know there are some who really dislike the new movies.  And that's completely fine. If you don't like them, I wont end up changing your mind.  I get it, they have flaws.  So did the prequels, hell, so did the original trilogy.  But for me, I love all of them.  They just remind me of a time where everything was great.  Even when they're bad, they're entertaining.

I went to see The Last Jedi with my father who saw all the originals as a kid, he absolutely loved it.  In fact he was just giddy the entire time.  That's the closest I've ever seen him being a kid again.

Initially, I was upset with the direction the writers took with Luke, but I ended up understanding. He's still human, he will have flaws.  It's just natural.  Honestly, all I did was just try and put myself in his shoes, and I probably would have done the same.  I think the Original Trilogy is so romanticized that people just completely forget about it's problems.  I mean, I love them but they're certainly not perfect. 

And really, we've had some of the most awesome and iconic shots from these new movies.  There's both Finn and Rey igniting the lightsaber for the first time, Darth Vader in the last 2 minutes of Rogue One, the throne scene in TLJ, Maul in Solo, and still so much more I'm probably forgetting.  Even with poor writing, you really can't deny they are very beautiful movies.

But watch the scene where he interacts with Leia again: the crate he sits on *clearly* moves with his body weight. He also touches Leia (though I suppose she could have felt nothing) and gives her dice, which disappear after his death. The dice seem to have weight as well, since they're able to be held and picked up. Are they just a manifestation of Luke's powers? 

So does Luke's projection have mass only when convenient? Was this just a mistake on Rian's part? Honestly, the reveal that he was a projection felt a bit cheap to me since he's shown to have weight in the previous scene. Let me know what you think.",Does Luke's force projection have mass?,0

"I think the films are reasonably enjoyable on a superficial level. Visually they’re absorbing and even better sonically. The scores are among the best ever written. I like the whole idea, the fairy tale world. But the stories are so weak and immature. Look at how most of the films end. Big showdown, the baddies lose, then all of a sudden it cuts to the goodies having a big celebration, roll credits. 

Sure it’s just a movie. And that’s alright for just a movie. But the whole mystique makes me hope for more. But there isn’t more. The stories are poorly written; the characters are unsympathetic; and there are no deep meanings to be found anywhere, no matter how much one might wish. There’s really nothing profound. 

Like I said, I do find the series enjoyable, but it’s only bubblegum. How can people take it all so seriously? Looking for meaning where it doesn’t exist might prevent one from finding the right answers

The T 65B x wing was already an extremely capable fighter capable of reaching ludicrous speeds (I heard that in Legends they could reach 0.75c with the aid of a gravity slingshot) and the jump to light speed is accomplish by a sudden acceleration and the passing to Hyperspace. Knowing all this why does Poe's T 70, a more modern design, need an extra engine to aproach the Mandator IV? Initially I though the Dreadnought had some sort of gravity well generator that made fighters go slower, turning them into easier targets(it would kind of explain why every ship is moving so slowly in the battle), and it was necessary to arrive with a higher speed, but this was never metioned as far as I know. StarWarsExplained even said it was the highest recorded speed achieved by an X wing, if it was acceleration it would be as bad but speed?
I guess you could say due to the proximity to the planet it was a little harder to accelerate, because you would be affecting you orbit and might start falling to the planet, but I can't help but feel confused.",What was the extra engine in Poe's x wing for?(TLJ),0

WOOKIE: The [Wellspring of Life](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wellspring_of_Life), a mystical [world](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Planet) located in the [heart](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Heart) of [the galaxy](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_galaxy), was the birthplace of a microscopic species that served as the link between the Living Force[\[3\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Planet-2) within all life forms and the infinite Cosmic Force.[\[6\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Priestesses-5) It was also the foundation of life,[\[3\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Planet-2) with all life forms serving a symbiotic host for the living organisms[\[1\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Episode_I-0) native to the wellspring.[\[3\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Planet-2) In modern science these intelligent microbes became known as ""midi-chlorians.""[\[7\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_planet-6) 

&amp;#x200B;

So is the *infinite cosmic force*, the life force of the galaxy as a being? One that has microscopic things balancing out forces within itself? I mean is it that far off from us as humans? Unseen things keeping a balance that keeps us alive?

"I recently read the original Thrawn trilogy, and wanted to say some things about it and the franchise in general. I never posted here before so I don't know what the popular opinions are.

So, I'll just say to start that I decided to read the Thrawn novels after being dissatisfied with the new movies. Especially the Last Jedi. I didn't like the idea of the story and characters going in the directions those movies went. More on that later. But I heard about the Thrawn novels, and how they were considered to be relatively high quality. So I figured that if there has to be a sequel trilogy, then it might as well be something that I can actually consider good, and respects the original story. I read them, and overall thought they were good. Not perfect of course. There were some flaws. Maybe a bit too slow at times, and the smugglers stuff sometimes felt a little too disconnected from the main story. And the ending of The Last Command was a little rushed. Not the stuff on Wayland, that was fine. But the final space battle and the epilogue, felt like they could have been expanded on. Other than that, pretty good.

However, I don't really have any desire to read any EU books that take place after The Thrawn Trilogy. This is partially because I like stories that actually have endings, instead of just going on and on indefinitely. It also  partially because many of the things that I've heard about the books seem to go against the spirit and/or story of the original movies. I'm going to mention some spoiler stuff here. This stuff includes: The Empire being continually rebuilt again and again after seemingly being defeated for good multiple times. Luke turning to the dark side. The Emperor being cloned/resurrected. Luke and other Jedi eventually gaining abilities that go far beyond anything shown in the movies, to the point where they basically become demi-gods. The revelation that the empire was actually created to counter an antagonistic alien race. To me, all of this just comes off as massive retconning and revisionism, and also makes a lot of the stuff that happened in the original movies seem trivial and/or pointless. I actually wouldn't mind reading some more about some of the new characters that were introduced in the Thrawn books, and the Vong at least sound interesting for being something different, and not just the Empire again. But I don't want to have to deal with all of that other stuff that goes with it.

This also ties into part of the reason I don't like the new movies. Quality aside, they go out of their way to make what happened in the original movies feel largely like a waste of time. Decades have passed, and the Empire (albeit under a different name) is still around. Han seemed to just wander away going back to doing what he did before. Luke abandoned everything he believed in. And its basically the same conflict between rebels and empire again, just with some new faces. So if nothing that happened in the old movies really mattered, then why should I care? Why does any of this matter? Maybe what happens in these new movies will end up not mattering as well. This isn't even getting into the numerous plot holes and underdeveloped characters.

All I wanted was stories that managed to do something different and tell a different sort of conflict, but while still respecting the spirit and story of the original movies. Was that so much to ask? Apparently. At least the Thrawn trilogy was good. Ad as far as I'm concerned, that's where the story ends. No rebuilt empire. No resurrected emperor. No Luke turning to the dark side, or abandoning everyone. No secret ""justified"" reason for the creation of the empire. None of that. The Last Command might not have been perfect, but I'll accept it as the ending to Star Wars, because its better than the alternatives.

Anyway, those are my opinions. If anyone has any comments or other opinions, feel free to share them.",Opinions on The Thrawn Trilogy and Wars in general,0

Apparently he was never even asked about contributing to the new films which is just a shame.

"Hi folks! I've been watching again the SW in order (1 to 8) and the CW and just started Rebels.

One thing that I have observed is that the jedis seems to have less movement over the ages : in the prequels and CW, Anakin and Obiwan are pretty much jumping long distances and having acrobatic fighting stances (older jedis too, like Dooku) while in the OT and sequels, the lightsaber wielders seems to be much more ""static"" and melee fighting not as jumpy/acrobatic. 

Now, I understand that when the OT was made, animation and technology at the time couldn't allow this kind of acrobatic cinema as today. But is there an explanation in the SW universe that explains the changes in fighting stances over the ages ?

Disclaimer, I still love The Last Jedi and consider it the best so far of the Disney canon films, and I am fine with the angle of weapon and ship manufacturers profiting off of the war, after all the military industrial complex in real life makes a lot of money so long as there are conflicts to profit from.

That being said, the big reveal DJ showed is basically X-Wings and TIE Fighters come from the same seller. At first I thought Sienar Fleet Systems went bankrupt after the fall of the Empire, which would make sense, and Incom bought them out and got all their assets, meaning they would be the manufacturer of both X-Wing and TIE Fighters. But it turns out, according to Wookipedia, that's not the case. Sienar is now Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems and Incom is now Incom-FreiTek, so they are as far as I can tell still separate entities. There is very little info on Incom-FreiTek on the Wookiepedia, so I don't know if any of the Disney canon books go into more detail about the current state of that company.

It's possible that the owner of the ship is some kind of reseller of ships and just buys from both corporations and sells them back to the Resistance and First Order, or perhaps even that DJ misinterpreted why the owner of that vessel had plans for both X-Wings and TIE Fighters.

These are the only two head canons I can come up with to explain what otherwise seems to be an oversight on the movie's part, which is certainly possible.",Something that I realized doesn't ad up with DJ's reveal on the seller's ship.,0

"Rather than just giving my opinion on Luke in the Last Jedi, I wrote down the way I understand both sides of the argument. Please read my arguments. Any discussion should be either explaining why you agree with the side you do, or objecting to my characterization of that side.

​

Pro:

Luke in the Last Jedi is an older, more complex, and conflicted version of the character. While he may have said that he would never join the dark side, that's more complicated than Return of the Jedi suggests. Struggling with the dark side is something Jedi do constantly, not something that can be stopped once. Seeing a vision of Kylo Ren's future made him momentarily forget his allegiance to the light, and he drew his lightsaber. He immediately realized his mistake, but he grew to doubt himself because of it. Decideding that he wasn't able to be a Jedi master, he grew to question his teachings. Immediately, Luke Skywalker retreated to an island, and vowed not to train any other Jedi.

​

Con:

~~Any justification for Luke's drastic change requires doing an incredible amount of mental gymnastics.~~ The movie clearly wasn't concerned much with explaining Luke's transformation, using the flimsy excuse of a vision. Spending such little time explaining why his characterization changed is disrespectful both to the character and the beloved films. In fact, this change in Luke's character throws his arc over all 3 movies out the window. In Return of the Jedi, Luke said he would NEVER join the dark side. Changing that is just blatant disregard to what those movies and Luke's character stands for,

​

Edit: People seem to be objecting to the mental gymnastics line, so I cut it.​ The wording was harsh.

"Minas Tirith is the Resistance, trapped on the edge of destruction, with a seemingly unstoppable force bearing down on it. Only time separates them from certain death.

Faramir is Finn, compelled to face this threat at the cost of his own life.

Now according to some logical perspectives, Faramir *must* try to do this thing. Minas Tirith knows nothing of Aragorn and the Paths of the Dead, much less Frodo and Sam's Quest to Mordor. Likewise, the Resistance knows nothing of Luke's plan to save the day.

But that doesn't make Faramir's sacrifice any less meaningless. Faramir almost dies, not in the service of his kingdom, but to appease the madness of his father (just as Finn attempts to die not in defense of his friends, but in personal anger regardless of his friends). Yes, it was Minas Tirith's only known hope. But that doesn't make it a good idea.

So what happens? Faramir survives by the skin of his teeth, knocked into a coma from the trauma of his injuries, and then what? Do Gandalf and Pippin rush out in a last-ditch effort at attrition? No, they hold back and try to figure out the next step.

Rose didn't know Luke was coming, but she *did* know that a dead Finn wasn't going to do anyone any favors. So like Gandalf, she made an effort to save her friends for whatever the future would hold, even if it means facing death *again*.

And before he dies, Fives says to Rex, “I was just trying to do my duty.” That just hurt me inside. Even the military police trooper that shot him took of his helmet and was upset with what he did.

*RS: Like father, like son.*


GL: He said, ""I want to be Darth Vader."" I said, ""You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract."" Hayden was grateful for this last movie, where he actually got to be Darth Vader.

*RS : It was interesting how many people wanted to see Darth Vader massacre the Jedis.*


GL: Well, when I said I was going to do the prequels, everybody said, ""That's great, we get to see Darth Vader kill everybody."" And I said, ""That's not the story."" When I announced that the first story was going to be about a nine-year-old boy, everybody here said, ""That's insane, you're going to destroy the whole franchise, it's More American Graffiti all over again."" And I said, ""Yeah, but this is the story.""

I don't have energy to just make hit movies. I'm not going to make James Bond Pt. 21 – I'm just not interested. Everybody said to drop the stuff about the midichlorians, it makes it too confusing. But it's a metaphor for a symbiotic relationship that allows life to exist. Everybody said it was going to be a giant turkey: ""This isn't going to help LucasFilm at all."" I said, ""This is about the movie and the company is just going to have to deal with whatever happens."" That's one of the reasons why there was so much hype on the first prequel: Everybody was terrified.

*RS: Having thought of Darth Vader as this ultimate evil, it was alarming to see him as a cute kid in ""The Phantom Menace,"" as if we were watching home movies of Hitler.*


GL: Well, a lot of people got very upset, saying he should've been this little demon kid. But the story is not about a guy who was born a monster – it's about a good boy who was loving and had exceptional powers, but how that eventually corrupted him and how he confused possessive love with compassionate love. That happens in Episode II: Regardless of how his mother died, Jedis are not supposed to take vengeance. And that's why they say he was too old to be a Jedi, because he made his emotional connections.

"I don’t know about y’all, but LSWTCS was and probably still is my favorite game. However, with recent technology, the game is somewhat outdated. The character customization is limited, the cutscenes have no words (just passionate grunts), and the content is lacking a couple of episodes. All I’m saying is that TT games would have an absolute banger on their hands if they remade TCS, but this time included episodes 7 &amp; 8 (and 9 when it comes out). Even include Rogue One and Solo side missions. Throw in some multiplayer co-op, maybe some PvP if they’re feeling ambitious, and updated character customization, I’d easily pay $60 for that. For how simple it is, Lego Star Wars is one of the best Star Wars games. TT games could take advantage of that, making both themselves and the consumers happy.

"In the original trilogy, Palpatine is feared by all. Nobody follows him out of loyalty, but rather fear for their lives. Yes, there were some who admired him, but most, especially the public truly feared him. Same with Snoke, no one admired him and looked up to him, they looked at him with fear in their eyes and hearts. This leads me to Episode IX. I want them to do something different, I want Kylo to be loved by the public. He has brought order, stability, and peace to the galaxy, and the galaxy has entered a new golden era. This will make it hard for our band of heroes, as they won’t be able to get allies, as they will be seen as terrorists; wanting chaos and conflict, with the public looking down on them with contempt. Would make it hard for them to take down Kylo, as he’s making the galaxy thrive better than it has in the last 60-70 years and the citizens loving their new leader.

"I don't expect that I will change your minds, but I think that what I have to say does lend some credibility to the opposite side of the argument. Let me preface this with the fact that I do not want to come across as mean-spirited in any way. I respect that there are many of you who don't like the film, and the writing even less. If you still don't like the writing for whatever reasons and aren't toxic about it, that is perfectly fine.

I had seen TLJ twice before I went again to see it with my mom, who hadn't seen it yet. My own opinions on the movie were pretty much solidified at that point. I loved the movie, and I thought the writing was great for the most part. Now, here's something to know about my mom. She got a PhD in theater arts, with a dual concentration in writing and theater production. Her mentor was Edward Albee, the 3-time Pulitzer Prize winning playwright best known for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" According to my mom, he was a tough mentor, and she developed high standards for writing as a result.

After the movie was done, the first thing she said was, ""Who wrote that movie? That writing was absolutely incredible!"" Now, I know this sounds like me saying ""My mom said it was great so therefore it's great!"" But even if she wasn't my mom and just a random stranger, I think that it is safe to say that she has an extensive knowledge of what makes great writing (which I admit can be entirely subjective), and it is worth considering that someone who was personally trained by an award-winning world-renowned playwright thinks that the writing for TLJ is phenomenal (her words, not mine). Now, I know that writing a play and writing a film are different, but there is some significant overlap, so I believe that her opinion on the writing is a valid opinion, seeing that she was trained in a tangential but similar style.

When she asked about why it was so divisive, I tried to give her as unbiased an answer as possible. I mentioned, people weren't happy with Luke's portrayal, people saw it as abandoning the setups of TFA, various plot holes, etc. She flat out disagreed. So take that as you will.

I really want to hear everybody's opinions, but I am especially curious to know what those who were dissatisfied with the movie think of this. Normally I post in /r/starwarscantina, but since this subreddit has a higher amount of people who weren't happy with the movie, I think it would be better to make this post here. If you're still not convinced, I accept that. I just thought I had an interesting viewpoint to share.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Based on the feedback so far, I've decided to elaborate on her opinions. We're in completely different states right now and she's working so I'm not going to bother her and call her up and ask her for a write-up.

She rewatched TFA before seeing TLJ, and she felt that Luke's role in TLJ was set-up in TFA. She thought that Han pretty much stated it exactly in TFA that Luke ran away and felt responsible for causing the current conflict. She didn't think that the map had any importance, only as a MacGuffin, and that Mark Hamill's facial reactions at the end of TFA indicate that he's not happy about being found. So it made sense to her that Luke would be in this dark place during TLJ.

Her favorite parts were the Rey-Luke-Kylo Ren dynamics. She thought that the writing for Kylo Ren was a great metaphor for mental illness, and she liked the dichotomy between how Rey and Kylo Ren handled their parental issues differently. She guessed from TFA that Rey's parents were nobodies and that Rey was in denial about this, so to my mom, Rey accepting that she came from nowhere but could still be special was pretty powerful.

She loved the use of the Force in this movie. We come from a Hindu background, and she saw this movie as espousing Hindu philosophy to the clearest extent in any movie in the franchise than ever before. She said that at the heart of the Force/Hindu philosophy,  it's all about having mental strength and superiority. That's why Rey is so powerful, because she readily accepts the power of the Force and allows it to control her.

She liked Canto Bight because it felt like old-style Hollywood filmmaking to her. She saw it as important to the overall theme in Star Wars of helping those in need. Now this was where we disagreed. I recognized that it could have been written better, but to her, the fact that it was a learning lesson to Finn was enough for her.

She didn't think that Holdo should've told Poe the plan because as she said, ""he was an idiot and recklessly got the bombers killed"". On that note, she liked that everyone had a lesson to learn in this movie: Rey to find belonging in herself, Poe to become a better leader, Finn to start believing in a cause and stop acting selfishly, Luke to accept failure, etc.

She didn't care about Snoke's backstory or why there's an Empire 2.0. Nor does she care about whether hyperspace ramming breaks or doesn't break established lore.

I hope that clears some things up. I don't want to sound like I'm flaunting someone's authority. I just wanted to offer a different perspective. Thanks for the feedback from everybody!","People who hated the writing of TLJ, what do you make of this?",0

What if some of the Knights, believing Luke to be dead and witnessing Ben and the others massacring the rest of the Jedi Temple, only chose to ""join"" Ben to stay alive and wait for a chance to take him out. I think this could be interesting because it could have Kylo Ren being threatened from all sides in Episode IX. You would have the Hux faction of the First Order against him, you would have Rey and the Resistance/New Republic remnants against him, and then you'd have some of his own Knights against him, which I think could lead to some cool things for his character.

"Hey everyone, so one of the things that makes Star Wars so iconic is their use of making the audience read a series of words before the movie starts. It’s such an amazing risk that George Lucas took, but it paid off so much. I was wondering how everyone would rank the crawls. Each one definitely seems to set the tone for the movie, and have their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s my ranking:

A New Hope: so there’s a bit of bias here because this is also my favorite movie, but I just love the idea that George Lucas threw us into this huge galaxy by explaining it all in about 30 seconds. It’s a true testament to movie making and understanding your audience’s intelligence. Plus it also essentially created the plot for the amazing Rogue One. 

The Force Awakens: Luke Skywalker has vanished. Wow. Say what you want about the sequel trilogy, but I can not give JJ enough respect for the guts it took to start off like that. I had made my best effort to avoid all spoilers going into the Force Awakens, but my entire life I’ve been wondering what happens next (the now legends books took their approach but even from the start I never fully trusted them) and right away JJ showed us that this is very much new world and that Luke is not the hero of this story. Again, feel how you may about the sequel trilogy, but you have to respect the creative courage it took to take that approach. 

Empire Strikes Back: so similar to the force awakens, the previous movie ended on this glorious celebration of victory. But not all is as positive as it may appear to be. Right away this crawl explains that it is a dark time for the rebellion, and that we are about to witness a movie that will push our heroes in new ways. Making it one of the greatest movies for quite a lot of people (like I said a New Hope is my favorite, but I can respect that empire is the better film)

So now here is where I think we will see everyone’s ranking start to go all over the place:

Revenge of the Sith: War! Need I say anything else? Yes, it’s cheesy, but I love it. An issue I have with the prequels is that we don’t get to see the actual clone wars (an issue that has been slightly solved thanks to the clone wars animated series) but this crawl definitely helped fill this gap that was filled with quite a lot of losses and changes for our heroes. 

The Last Jedi: I’ll never forget the speculation leading up to the release of the Last Jedi. We all knew it would had by far the shortest time jump of the movies, so we wondered how on earth they could create a crawl for it. I really respect how this crawl made an effort to fill in the blanks left by the Force Awakens as far as politics and galactic control are concerned  

Attack of the Clones: this isn’t so much because of the crawl, but because George decided this would be the one movie that pans up after the crawl, leading to us all wondering every single time whether or not the pan will be up or down. 

Return of the Jedi: I think this crawl is a reason why a lot of people wondered what the Last Jedi would be able to do for theirs. The second shortest time between movies, it really doesn’t go to far into details. Yeah it explains Luke returns home, and there’s a second Death Star. But that’s it. The real perfection of this movies comes from the twists found in Jabba’s Palace, which the crawl certainly doesn’t give away. 

The Phantom Menace: The taxation of trade routes. Oof. Yeah, that doesn’t get you super excited. I appreciate the phantom menace for the fact it brought back star wars, and introduced us to Maul, one of my favorite canon characters. But we can all agree, we do not ever need trade route discussions in future Star Wars movies. 


Lastly just a quick ranking of the so far two movies without a crawl:

Rogue One: if you were to make each crawl into a visual presentation, I feel like Rogue One would be a perfect example of this. I could easily picture the opening just being described in words, but I love that they took the extra step and gave us some more screen time with Galen Erso. 

Solo: it’s a solid take on a screen crawl, separating it into separate slides, but it’s nothing special. ",Ranking The Opening Screen Crawls,0

Even if Plinkett and other cynical youtube “reviewers” sas otherwise: People generally love lightsaber action.

What people mention the most on this sub:

-Old Republic with either the story of Darth Bane being told (which fits perfectly in the rest of the saga) or  the mandalorian wars with Revan

-Kenobi (the important difference to Solo is here that people love Ewan McGregor) on Tatooine, between the conflict of Tusken and moisture farmers. 

-gritty clones movie, cameos of Ahsoka, Ewan and Hayden, something like the battle of Jabiim, or labyrinth of evil or republic commando there are a lot of ideas out there.

-Thrawn whether as the villain or the protagonist. This guy is the most important EU character of all time and the posterboy of what people considered to be the sequel trilogy for many years. Maybe Zahns third canon novel should become a movie.

-Darth Plagueis he is a mystery and pulled the strings before Episode I. The fans love this character although not much is known about him. The movie would have to be more political and going into prequel territory, but if made well this could be the kind of “different” Star Wars film, the franchise needs.

- Vader. Since Rogue One a lot of people like the idea of a group of Jedi in the Dark times being hunt down by Darth Vader. 

-Knights of Ren/ New Republic/ Luke Jedi Order. Many people want something that fills the gap between the battle of Jakku and TFA that isn’t a book.

-Shadows of the empire. This is more interesting for the older generation of Star Wars fans. A multimedia project that got anything but a film should get a movie too. And let’s be honest: Benedict Cumberbatch would be the perfect Xizor.

-Boba Fett/ Bounty Hunters/ Underworld. This idea is growing in the fanbase since the first rumours of a live action series from George Lucas. People just want the concepts of 1313 to happen in any form.

-Episodes X-XII. This is for the far future, but should be
mentioned here nonetheless. Reys new jedi order has to face a new enemy that is not remnants of the empire. People tend to wish for the Grysks, which are everything people did like about the Vong.

What else is there? Do you agree/ disagree?

It would be Leia of course but sadly she will not be in the next movie. So that leaves only a few options. Rey? Probably not as she will most likely be doing Jedi things and too busy getting into lightsaber battles. Poe? Maybe but I feel he is a dangerous candidate because he is one of their best pilots they have and they will need that skill to succeed. Finn is barely a Resistance member and Rose is just a mechanic. I don't get why Chewie hasn't taken the Falcon and flown off into the sunset already and he seems to be more and more regulated to a side character. That leaves me with just one idea. He is a character that has been through so much. Lost so many friends and compatriots. He has been around since the beginning of everything. He even currently has a sizable spy force sprinkled across the galaxy. That is right. I think the new leader of the Resistance will be: C-3PO!

"The entire setup for the Battle of Crait proceeds as depicted in the film. However, Kylo Ren appears as a sole emissary of the First Order on the battlefield, expecting Leia, Holdo, or another high ranking Resistance member to meet him to deliberate terms of surrender. The walkers loom in the background, and shots of the remaining Resistance members indicate their defeated demeanor, as many of them are moving into the acceptance of their inevitable death. 

Leia walks out into the salt flats, ready to face what’s left of her son. Once Ren sees that she’s away from the base and approaching him, he orders an all out annihilation of the remaining Resistance forces. 

We cut to multiple First Order TIE fighter pilots receiving the order via radio. “STANDING BY TO ENGAGE” is repeated multiple times. But then, right before Ren orders the fighters to attack, we hear a soft static overtake. “Red 5 standing by.” 

Imagine “March of the Resistance” from the Force Awakens soundtrack playing behind the following suggestion:

Both the Milennium Falcon and a Rebellion-era X-WING appears over the mountainside, two ships, parallel to one another. They drive alone, straight into the onslaught of oncoming TIE fighters and walkers. 

Ren orders every fighter to attack the Falcon, trying to rid himself of his own self-fulfilling pain. Luke, piloting the X-WING along with Rey, fly directly up to the edge of all 15 AT-AT walkers before turning parallel to their walking paths. As all of the available First Order firepower destroys the Falcon, Luke shouts “now R2!”. At that moment R2 ejects Luke’s green lightsaber from the X-WING. Luke then yells, “Rey!”. From the backseat of the X-WING, Rey uses the force to balance the ignited lightsaber a few feet from the right side of the X-WING while Luke flys down the row of AT-AT walkers, the saber slicing the front legs of every single one.

"This is kind of a response post. I was talking about the ""Force speed/teleport"" seen in ep1, and I was replied by saying I was just hating the prequels cause that's a bandwagon thing.

I'll now post this, proving that comment wrong, all while showing I'm just talking about my own opinions and thoughts.

Ok so in e6, Luke surrenders himself to the Empire for a variety of reasons. His motivation for this decision includes things like force users could sense him, so he had to get away from the rebels. Another reason is that Luke knew in his heart that Vader couldn't and wouldn't  kill him. 

His plan once surrendered was to turn Vader to the good side and prove the Emperor wrong.

What is the Emperor's thought process here? Well he knew Luke would end up alone with them, to confront them. Now his goal is to turn Luke to the dark side. He keeps talking about letting go and strike down his own father. Except the entire time Luke's there, he's acting like a pacifist. I really don't understand why the Emperor would think Luke would not only join the Dark side, but kill his own father to do so, with no motivation or reason to do so. This while Luke's trying to get Vader back to the light side with every fiber of his being. 

I will give the Emperor credit for making Luke want to kill him, which would lead to dark side emotions and Midiclorians, but it was played out in a really clunky way.",What's the deal with the Emperor's plan?,0

Imagine the outrage if Humans said they wanted all-Human ships. So why do the Vulcans get to do this?

"—likely to be controversial

I’ve tried watching a few episodes, remaining as objective as possible, but this show seems to always leave me unsatisfied and ultimately puzzled as to what the writers were going for with a lot of the choices they made during production. It just doesn’t ‘feel’ like Star Trek to me.

I watched [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSn0d56Eqw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1m29s) scene the other day. At first, I was just confused, so I rewatched it; after the second time through, I was no less confused as to what exactly it was that I just saw, but this time i became suddenly appalled by the realization that this show carries the same name as previous installments of the franchise such as The Next Generation or even The Original Series. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m open to new ideas and even a new direction for the franchise entirely, but this just doesn’t seem right to me. I’d like some opposing opinions on the matter to consider. 

Here are some scenes from past series that are similar in nature to this one, yet, in my opinion, retain more of what I would consider the underlying themes of Star Trek as a whole: [1](https://youtu.be/JGn948_PXTU?t=1m23s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmldpYnFzw), or even [3](https://youtu.be/zlGRNRAL148?t=30s). 

For me, Star Trek Discovery is the confused grandchild of a tv show that was supposed to explore our inner selves more so than anything else. It is overly overt, distractingly glamorous, and too concerned with setting its self apart from the past that it often falls short in the areas that truly matter. 

Edit: 

1) As many of you have stated, and correctly so, Discovery is still in its infancy as a tv show. It would be wrong in saying that all the past shows did not have a rocky beginning as well, so it is best to remain open minded. However, I can say that I think out of all the shows, early season difficulties considered, Discovery still is the farthest from the rest both in terms of story telling and aesthetics. Ultimately, I will maintain a cautious yet optimistic outlook.

2) How the clips are related. 

I chose the three scenes from past Star Trek shows because, they are, at least in the most basic sense, similar in terms of subject and narrative, so there is a point of comparison to be made. Furthermore, I think there is a clear contrast between how the prior shows handled a scene like this compared to Discovery: This includes everything involved; plot, resolution, character interaction, visuals, effects, montage, camera use, etc. In full, the muse-en-scene  is what is in question.

"I started watching Star Trek for the first time last year, and I'm up to Voyager S3:E1. On the subject of Lon Suder (the homicidal + creepy Betazoid ex-Marquis), and the holographic doctor referred to him as a ""sociopath"". 


This may be a minor detail, but it's actually bothering me. He's listed as a sociopath where ever he's mentioned, but... Wouldn't it be more accurate to refer to him as a psychopath? 


As far as I'm aware, he has never shown remorse for killing his fellow crewmate. He's merely trying to control his homicidal urges. Nothing about him indicates to me that he is a ""sociopath"", yet everything about him indicates to me that he is a ""psychopath"". 


What's the deal? Did Star Trek's writers just make a mistake, and everyone just ""went with it"", and it became canon? Or am I mistaken? Technically you could call him a sociopath, but it just seems much more accurate to use the term psychopath. The medical doctor **should know the difference**. 


At best, this might be explained away by saying ""in 2373, the term psychopath no longer exists"" or something.

Rewatching DS9 Way of the Warrior and once again disturbed by Martok, Sisko and Kira using the same knife to cut their hands. I love how it shows the pointlessness of blood testing but I also wonder if the Klingon empire experienced an uptick in blood borne disease infections during the Dominion war.",Dominion war and spread of blood borne pathogens?,1
"I was watching the DS9 first season finale yesterday, In the Hands of the Prophets (still one of the most underrated season finale's ever). I was watching the scene Keiko O'Brien and evil woman Vedek Winn debate over the wormhole aliens, orbs, etc as a religion vs science issue. 

It was a good reminder how much DS9 went out of its way to create it's mini-universe within a universe. None of those concepts were ever heard of in Star Trek until DS9 introduced them. And they really built up those ideas more in later seasons. And of course their mythology got even bigger once the Dominion was introduced and gave us not just a new villain but a entire story line built around them that went on for years.

Then I started thinking about Star Trek in general and just how big the overall mythology has become because every show has added to it in some way offering up new conflicts, aliens and concepts.

All except Discovery. :(

It's crazy but it's true. Just stay with me here, but every show from TOS to Enterprise has all introduced completely new ideas and concepts to the Trek universe. Just a tiny example of what I mean:

TOS- Well it's obvious being the first it set up everything in the universe: Starfleet, Klingons. Vulcans, Romulan war, 23rd century, etc, etc. And pretty much every major element from that show has been used on most shows in some fashion. 

TNG- It's first season set up the 24th century, but also gave us the Ferengi (yeah, I know), Q, the Borg (although didn't actually see them until second season), crazy new tech like holodecks, etc. It gave us old elements from TOS like the Klingons and star ships, but it prided itself on presenting new aliens and threats in its very first season.

DS9 has been mentioned.

Voyager- LOL that entire show created multiple new species and concepts being in the Delta quadrant of course. The Borg became it's main threat in later seasons but Voyager had tons of new species to play with and created a lot stories around them like the Kazon and the Ocampa being the first major arc.

Enterprise- While it's a prequel it actually went out of its way to create a lot of new mythology and background. Being in the only show in the 22nd century basically set up that era the way TNG did with the 24th. It laid the ground work of how Starfleet was perceived in the early days of space travel. But it still went farther by giving us the Temporal Cold War and the Suliban in the first season. It introduced a completely new idea in Star Trek and different species fighting over various timelines. And then later of course we got the Xindi arc which added to TCW but were a new villain completely.

And then we get to Discovery. And sadly they have added nothing to their own like the other shows started out. The only original concept the show has created is the spore drive and mycelial network. It's completely new but it's more of a plot device instead of a brand new story line. But outside of that, what was new?  They stuck to the Star Trek tradition of introducing a new alien we never seen before in Saru but that's really it. They have filled in concepts other shows already created like the Mirror Universe and the Klingon war. Next season we're getting Section 31 but that came from DS9. 

Is it a big deal, no, since it just hit me recently they didn't do anything new but it is odd DIS for all it's talk of being 'different' and 'modern' hasn't created any truly original ideas outside of one. Even when it came to new aliens, there has basically been two introduced so far: Saru and the Phavo aliens, which we saw in one episode. We see others walk around but we know zip about them. 

So maybe next season this show will create it's own mythology unique to Discovery but so far it's seriously lagging behind the others which is weird given how all the other shows went out their way to create new villains, histories and concepts.

To put this into some context, the very first science fiction show I ever watched was West World.  That, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

I loved Space: 1999 even though I questioned how the moon could travel so far through space so quickly (my mom said, ""Don't worry about it.  It's just a TV show. They do dumb stuff like that."" or words to that effect). Later I watched Dr. Who (Tom Baker is my Doctor, the others are pale imitations).  I read Heinlein and Asimov and Bova and Pournelle and Niven. I knew what Science Fiction was.

My character is outfitted with a mind control device and I'm ordered to assist in implementing tech into other Romulans.

The dialog options have me the choice to resist. So I did. And I kept doing it, purposely sabotaging the implants. As time wore on, my sabotages became more violent and brutal. And eventually it dawned on me. In resisting, I'm causing greater harm to, and perhaps killing others. If I continued to resist, I'd be causing more suffering.

So I conceded. I stopped harming them.and followed orders. They won and beat me. They had control. Well, at least until my friends got me out. Hey, you need agency in a game, after all.

This mission has stuck with me more than the others. It forced me to stop and think about my decisions. Was I doing the right thing? Or was I putting my well being above those around me? I have yet to see another trek mission (minus fanmade ones) evoke a similar reaction to me. I love that mission.","Remembered my favorite Trek Online mission.

Overall this series has just been incredible. Amazing characters and great long running stories. I think I was most impressed by the ""villains"" of the show which I only state that way because this is absolutely a show about change. Watching someone like Damar and the way he goes from background extra, to hated POS, to savior is just amazing. And of course Kai Winn is just one of the best written characters ever. And the crew is great to, especially Jadzia who is everything I aspire to be. Also Bashir and O'Brien forever. Like any Star Trek show it wasn't perfect, but I just loved it all so much along the way!

\#ReleaseDS9onBluRay",My friends and I just posted our final episode of our Deep Space Nine watch-along podcast. All three of us can safely now say it's our favorite Trek show.,1
"Besides casting minorities, what made TOS so revolutionary? I know it is, but I'm curious, like, from a historical standpoint, did TOS really change television forever, etc.? Were the scripts really outstanding for that time period (I mean, the writing is still great for today, so)?",What made TOS so revolutionary?,1
"I really really enjoy the characters and situations in this series, especially the crazy mind warping episodes (usually involving some kind of anomaly or universe shifting), and I was hoping other series followed a similar trend of episode styles. I'm in love with all of the characters and the developments they went through and progress of everything, and while I know others don't believe the new generation is the best series, it's set a pretty high standard for what I would want in a star trek series. Based on that, what's the next best series to carry on these qualities I love?

Edit: I have watched some of the original series but not all of it. It was a while ago but my fiance wasn't really into it so we moved on, it was about a year later a picked up tng. He wanted to watch it for whoopi goldberg, I wanted to watch it for Patrick Stewart.","I am just about to finish TNG, and I've seen lots of posts recommending the next step. But do any other seasons bear similarities to this?",1
"Just curious out there but what do people consider when Star Trek was at it's peak? I don't mean just ratings and popularity (although that can certainly be included of course) but when you felt Trek was at it's best? Or most exciting?

And I don't mean just one show but the franchise in general? And maybe a span of 10 years, give or take a few. You can start from the first year when TOS started all the way up until now (since the Kelvin films have been around 9 years now and Discovery has started). 

For me personally, I think it's 1990 to 2000. That was a rich history of Trek for a number of reasons:

A. This was when TNG came into it's element, specifically in 1990 because that was around it's third season and when the show took off both creatively and popularity. 

B. While TUC wasn't the best TOS film, it was damn near close and was a great way to end those adventures. And 1991 was the 25th anniversary of the franchise marking a pivotal moment.

C. DS9 premiered in 1993 and turned into one of the best shows IMO. And it finished in the year 2000. It also showed that Star Trek could just do more than fly in star ships and we started to see cracks in Federation virtue.  Sadly haven't gotten a show like it since.

D. While not super successful TNG launched into films and did give us one of the biggest events in Trek history, having Kirk and Picard in the same film in Generations. For people who were around back then this did feel monumental in so many ways. A Star Trek film made the cover of Time Magazine. That said a lot. First Contact is still one of the best Trek films and was a great tie in to the 30th anniversary putting the Borg on the big screen. Sadly I have not been as excited about a Trek film since. 

E. Voyager premiering in 1995. Yes the show isn't as great as the others but it's still a great show. And Voyager actually created a few milestones on its own. It was the first Star Trek show since TOS to premiere on a network, 29 years later. It's pilot, Caretaker, to this day is the most watched Trek pilot with around 22 million viewers. And that was a relief because it was also the most costliest Trek pilot lol. One of the costliest period at $23 million. In 1995 at that. To this day only two other pilots cost more: Game of Thrones and Westworld. And yes our first woman Captain! 

E. And this probably was when Trek was at it's most popular in regards to merchandise and awareness. I remember walking into a Toys R Us back in 97 and there was an shelf devoted to Star Trek. Models, toys, games, etc. This was when new characters would show up after an episode aired and thrown up on shelves. You could buy Star Trek everything from clocks to bed sheets. And I was personally buying this stuff. I had my own Star Trek shelf of toys, episodes and movies, soundtracks, books, trading cards and even the Star Trek communicator magazine. Yes HUGE nerd lol! 

For me, this was definitely when I think Trek was at it's golden age. There was just always something going on. Trek felt mainstream in the sense you turn on a TV it was on somewhere. Because so many new shows were coming out new fans were always finding it. They still find it like here but at that time it was already so big that it I knew someone who was watching some of it if not all. 

But like I said, this is just my opinion. Some people it may be when TOS started and when fandom was just getting going through the first TOS film. Others my think it was when TWOK hit theaters and had a good run through TUC. Some may even think the first Kelvin film gave us a new and different era from all of those and made Trek mainstream it never was before.

"I've decided to start my newbie kind of overview. I will write one at the end of every season I watch.

So first off, we start off with:

Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 1 -  \_\_\_  episodes

**Best 5 Episodes - Best to Worst**

1. Datalore
2. Conspiracy
3. 11001001
4. Arsenal of Freedom
5. The Neutral Zone

Explanation: Datalore was amazing to me, honestly, I loved all of it, especially that last transporter fight with Wesley, Lore, and Data. Conspiracy was very memorable and very dark and engaging. 11001001 was just overall a good episode, with cool aliens, and a believable plot. Arsenal of Freedom was also a good episode, with character development for Geordi, and more on Crusher and Picard. The Neutral Zone was anti climatic, but the beginning was amazing. The music in the meeting room close to the beginning was perfect. And it also hinted on the Borg, as well.

Honorable Mentions:

Home Soil: Loved this fun detective episode

Heart of Glory: Gave us background on Worf and Klingons.

The Battle: Also a great episode, but it always gives me a headache, not because it is bad, but because Picard had headaches.

**Worst 5 Episodes - Worst to Best**

1. Code of Honor
2. The Naked Now
3. Angel One
4. Justice
5. When the Bough Breaks

Explanation: Code of Honor was not just boring, but also a plain racist story, The Naked Now was weird and the plot wasn't too intriguing, it was a rehash of the Naked Time. Angel One was also sexist, in a way, with the whole men-women thing flipped around, and the B-plot, the cold, was kind of... silly, Justice was hard to believe, and very corny and silly, what with Wesley falling into flowers... And When the Bough Breaks was full of plotholes, like why do they just pick so little children, wouldn't they have picked more?  Sorry if that wasn't a lot, but there isn't really that much to say.

​

**Bonuses:**

​

Most overrated = The Big Goodbye

Not saying it is bad, but some parts of it was sort of boring and I thought it wasn't as good as a lot of other episodes, still in the higher range for Season 1, but not the best.

Also: Hide and Q

Good episode, but still not really **that** good.

Also: Where No One Has Gone Before

I didn't really find it to be all that good, unfortunately. Some parts of it were boring.

​

Most memorable = Conspiracy

What with exploding heads and eating parasites, of course this is very memorable!

​

**Conclusion:**

Well, I guess that's all! Remember, this is my opinion and is not a general guide or anything, I recommend watching all the episodes, like for me, Justice and When the Bough Breaks weren't half as bad as I thought they would be.

I'm marking as spoiler because I don't know if this counts or not.

Also, I'm a noob Trekkie, so don't be too hard on me. Hope you all Live Long and Prosper!

"I had my M-5 multitronic unit, which I picked up for a song on eBay some years ago, analyze and rank the six Star Trek TV series theme songs in order of best to worst. As always, the M-5's results are [foolproof and incapable of error](https://youtu.be/AD8YvY7PqYY?t=53s).

1. [**Star Trek: Voyager**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtVXAugaSm0)**.** Dennis McCarthy's haunting theme never fails to send a shiver up my spine. In less than two minutes McCarthy manages to convey both the existential sadness and the shining optimism that drives the good ship *Voyager*, trapped 75 years away from everything any of its crew have ever loved in this life, to find a way to cheat physics and get themselves the hell home.
2. [**Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc_0ii3SLp0)**.** This was going to be my number one entry until I remembered that Voyager was a thing. The amazing Dennis McCarthy once again comes through with a theme that's perfect for a lonely space station located on--deal with it, Kira--the galactic frontier. McCarthy is at his best when he gets to work with an Aaron Copland-esque wonder at the unknown, and he delivers here in spades.
3. [**Star Trek**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjL8WXjlGI)**.** This is where it all began, and it pains me to rank it third out of six. Alexander Courage's genuinely timeless fourteen-note intro has become one of the most recognizable musical motifs of the twentieth century, a feat that becomes more jaw-droppingly amazing the more one thinks about it, and is directly quoted in the themes of two of its successor series. Alas, its greatness is marred by the somewhat dated main theme that follows, which in TOS's second and third seasons features vocalising that... well, it's a product of its time, let's leave it at that.
4. [**Star Trek: Discovery**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcTvrxwP6Is)**.** The newcomer comes through with a surprisingly strong entry from composer Jeff Russo. Let's be honest here: The Discovery theme is a mess, but it's a glorious mess. Russo starts by acknowledging just two notes of Alexander Courage's iconic, half-century-old TOS theme, then launches into an entirely new composition that is nevertheless informed by at least three Berman-era themes, only to return a minute later to Courage's timeless signature. I nearly cried the first time I heard it. No lie.
5. [**Star Trek: The Next Generation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsxgcLf0TSY)**.** The good news is that it starts with Alexander Courage's classic fanfare. The bad news is that it's followed up by Jerry Goldsmith's recycled theme for TMP, which was showing its age even in 1987. To 2018 ears,  it comes across as bombastic nonsense to the point of self-parody. Look, I know that for many of you TNG was your first exposure to Trek and this theme will always hold a place in your heart, but the sooner you come to terms with the fact that the theme is complete crap, the better. Rarely have I been more grateful for Netflix's ""Skip Opening Credits"" option.
6. **Star Trek: Enterprise**, which I refuse to link for self-respect reasons. The less said about this perfunctory MOR offering from schlockmeister Diane Warren, the better. True confession time: I genuinely have only heard this theme song in its entirety approximately twice, because I owned a TiVo DVR back in 2001, and I only ever needed to hear this fragrant piece of shit once or twice before it became abundantly clear that I never, ever needed to hear it again. So fuck you, Diane Warren, I don't give a shit how goddamn long of a road it's fucking been, and I never will. I--Jesus, I'm legitimately getting angry about this, and it's been seventeen years. In conclusion, fuck you Diane Warren.

How does it work?
As with all RP's, you can create a character with backstory, species, etc. Once you have your character, that's it! You can begin RP at any time once your character is accepted. You will have your own quarters as well (May have a roommate). 
Besides that we use Discord's functions to create a rank and department (science, tactical, medical, operation and engineering) system and to simulate the many rooms present on a large starship. 
Additionally, we work with ""episodes and seasons"". Similar to actual Star Trek show. (For reference, we are currently in season 2 episode 18 as of writing this).

What do I need to join?
You only need three things:
1. Proper english. It doesn't have to be perfect (I'm not natively english speaking myself either), but if you can understand and replicate what's said in Star Trek shows you're good!
2. Will to RP.
3. Maturity. The server is considered 18+ (due to some romance, but you will find it limited in the ERP sense, only in quarters).

If you feel interested feel free to check out the server. If you don't rp (and of course don't cause trouble) you are always welcome to just hang out and check out our top-kek memes/game nights!

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, or (assuming you joined the server, which will explain many potential questions with a more detailed explanation and ruleset) you can PM me, or ask anyone your question in the general OOC channel.

Now I haven’t seen EVERY episode in quite some time so while binge viewing on YouTube I came to this, one of the more ballyhooed episodes. Now for those of you unaware, “The Inner Light” concerns Picard being knocked unconscious by a probe and living for some 40 years as a man in a doomed civilization. At first he’s focused on reaching the Enterprise, and gradually he fits in and lives a full life among them complete with family. By the end Picard returns to consciousness with the newfound knowledge of these long dead people. Firstly, from a practical perspective this is a Picard episode. That means if you watch the show because you enjoy ANY other character, you’re SOL. From a plot perspective, you’re telling me this civilization has a probe capable of this, yet spend the entire episode talking about their primitive tech and inability to send people into space?! What’s more, they apparently agreed this torture is the best method for passing on their culture. Lastly, the character of Picard falls victim to Stockholm syndrome. He has no ill-will toward his captors nor their grand duping. Totally out of character.

I maybe it's old(er) age and franchise fatigue on my part, but seeing multiple actors play certain roles within a ten year span, or on TV shows versus movies (DC universe) just doesn't seem right and dilutes the general image of characters. Obviously characters being played by multiple actors is an accepted part of fictional media, but I think it should be avoided where possible.

There's a reason so many people want to see Stewart back as Picard. Even if Pine can't compare the the Shakepearean skill of Stewart, keeping the cast together for a couple movies would cement him more solidly as Kirk. Let him actually spend some time contemplating being his character instead of jumping and running around all movie and it might turn out he can act.",Actors Matter,1

There's a scene in ""The Man Trap"" where Kirk is down on a planet, trying to raise the Enterprise on his communicator to warn them about an alien that's loose on board. At around the 38:36 mark, Netflix reckoning, he pulls out the communicator and says, ""Trek to Enterprise"", to which Sulu responds ""Bridge to Captain"". What's up with that ""Trek to Enterprise"" line?

I've seen the films, played the video game, and read all of IDW's 'Star Trek: Ongoing' and 'Star Trek: Boldly Go' and I love it so much. It also reinforces my feeling that Star Trek works best as a series and films do it a bit of a disservice.

"I am rewatching voyager and in s2e21 “deadlock” there is a conversation about Neelix using fresh food over the synthetic “replicator food” but the yields from the hydroponics bay had been low. This got me thinking, mostly around voyager needing a hydroponics bay to make food so replicator energy wasn’t used as often. what if seeds were made using the replicator systems, could they have been used to grow “earth food”. 

Perhaps possibly getting the seeds to geminate through splicing with alien plants/vegetables. We know it’s possible as Tuvox has shown in an earlier episode how he created a new type of orchard by taking cuttings from (I think it was an earth orchard) and attaching the to a Vulcan orchard; creating an entirely new plant.  

 Possible reasons to do this (in voyagers case)? Earth food dishes being more earth like (neelix tries bless him) ability to cultivate/farm more food, saves the need to trade for food/search for food. 

I know replicators can my crest “life” so not sure how this could work. 

Further to this, more of an after thought, what about using transporters to replicate living things. We know patten buffers are stored in the transporters so when someone/something is transported, de materialised  and then reintegrated it could be possible to create infinite copies. Again this is possible due to the existence of two William Rikers. Now I am not saying they could make more people but again along the terms of plants/food a transporter/replicator mash up? It could have also have solved limited resources on voyager. Sorry to keep using voyager as an example it’s what I am currently rewatching.)

"I recently had two very long drives (14+ hours each).  To maintain my sanity, and provide some entertainment, I picked up a bunch of Star Trek audiobooks.  For the super short summary jump to the end.

**Star Trek: The Next Generation**  
**The Genesis Wave Series**

Read by Tim Russ, this was a very entertaining series.  My TV guide summary would be: someone, somewhere, has revived the Genesis Project in a horrible new way and the crew of the Enterprise must save the galaxy.

It felt like a pretty solid multi-episode arc that you would never see on TNG when it originally aired.  I think it just requires too much ""continuity"" between franchises (it uses elements from TOS, TNG, and DS9) to work in TNG's television paradigm back in the day.  It had a great Star Trek feel, but with a greater freedom than the TV format allows.

Do you have to read/listen to all four books to get closure?  No.  Sort of.  To be fair, my recollection is a bit fuzzy due to the mindlessness of driving for 14 hours, but here's what I remember.

Book One sets up the Genesis Wave and the horrors it unleashes.  Can the Enterprise find the source?

Book Two has the Enterprise investigating the source and trying to find a way to stop it.

Book Three apparently was written later (I just learned that now!) which would explain why it felt like it could stand alone.  Basically the technology from Books One and Two has fallen into the hands of a religious zealot and new troubles arise.

Book Four is the book of Worf.  Ok that's an exaggeration.  But, I kept wondering where he was for Books 1-3, and this book answers that question.  It basically is a standalone episode focusing on one planet affected by the Genesis Wave.

Tim Russ does a great job narrating.  He doesn't do ""voices"" necessarily, but the way he voices the different characters is fantastic.  He includes speech mannerisms like pacing, emphasis, etc. Along with the author's dialogue for the characters, you can get a pretty good sense of who's talking to whom.

I did feel like the series was a bit ""darker"" than TNG I'm used to.  For example: the very premise of the book requires the destruction of several planets with large populations.  I know we've seen destruction before (Borg, the Nexus) but this felt darker.

I'd recommend books 1 and 2 if you only have a 7-hour drive.  If you've got closer to 10 hours, add book 4.  Only if you're on a really long drive, or really want a bunch of audiobooks, would I recommend book 3.

[My main complaint about Book 3 is spoiler-y:](#s ""There were a bunch of passages written where I was like 'Why is the author spending so much time describing how attractive a female alien is?' Well it turns out it's because she was manipulating Picard's mind to make him fall so desperately in love with him that he'd undo his whole career and life for her.  So it was decent writing, but I just felt like it was a really cheesy plot device.  I dunno... it just didn't work for me"")

**Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**
**Legends of the Ferengi**

Clearly a money-making tie-in of a book.  I still enjoyed it. 
 ~~Armin Shimerman~~ Quark narrates and basically it's a bunch of short stories to illustrate various Ferengi Rules of Acquisition.

Remember the episode of DS9 where they had that educational program for children and Quark was teaching them math?  It basically felt like that.  It was an entertaining way to pass an hour.

Major caveat: the audio quality on this sounds like it was pulled from a cassette tape found at a used book store.  Ok, I exaggerate slightly, but be ready to adjust your EQ and deal with 90s audio.

**Star Trek**
**Spock vs. Q: The Sequel**

I *loved* the first Spock vs Q but didn't know there was a sequel until last week.  While not as good as the first, this one still does a great job.  John De Lancie and Leonard Nimoy both sound like they had a lot of fun making this.  There's a lot of role-reversal humor in this one and while it's enjoyable, there are definitely some jokes that don't land as well.

**Star Trek**
**The Eugenics Wars: Book Two**

By mistake I picked up book two instead of book one.  But I figured it shouldn't be too hard to catch up.  After all, even the Genesis Wave books do a good job of reminding you what happened in the last book.

I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as the others.  The main thing it had going for it was Rene Auberjonois' narration.  While some of his accents aren't perfect, I felt he captured the characters' personalities well in his portrayals.  It was easy for me to know who was speaking at any time, even when I was tuned out to focus on driving.

The plot, as far as I can gather, is that Khan and his genetically-enhanced kin escaped from the facility creating them and have run amok.  Gary Seven is on the case, but apart from him barely anyone knows that the Eugenics War is even happening.  The plot spent more time on the infighting among the genetically-enhanced than any threat from them against ""normal"" humans.  When TOS or TNG refer to the Eugenics Wars they talk as if everyone knows about the horrors that took place.  But this book makes it seem like only a small number of people ever knew what was happening, and the horrors don't actually seem that bad.

I got the feeling that the Eugenics Wars were discussed in the same discussions of other atrocities of the 1980s and 1990s, and that they were all linked in the cultural memory of the Federation.  While this book does discuss the participation of the genetically-enhanced in conflicts in Bosnia, Rwanda, and American extremists, because it's all so cloak-and-dagger hidden from the rest of the world made it lose a lot of impact for me.

I think this series is probably worth skipping.

**In brief**

* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Books 1 and 2.  Recommended!  Enjoyable.  Good TNG.
* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Book 3.  Weakest of the four books.  Skippable.
* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Book 4.  Enjoyable.  Worf gets a turn.
* Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Legends of the Ferengi.  Entertaining fluff.  If you don't like Quark or the Ferengi, you won't like this.
* Star Trek: Spock vs Q: The Sequel.  Highly recommended, but not as amazing as the original.
* Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: Book Two.  Skip it.  Plot feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode ",Audiobook roadtrip review,1

[EDIT] I forgot to add that Dax also has a Lesbian affair with her wife from a previous lifetime. 
I’m thrilled that Discovery finally has a gay character but it’s too little too late. 
As a gay man my favorite character and the character who I think most represented LGBT culture is Lwaxana Troi, she is fabulous, fashionable, outrageous, sassy and always wearing the latest styles, in some ways she reminds me of a Drag Queen and I plan to attend my next Trek Con as Lwaxana in Drag! Overall Star Trek is amazing and tackled many social issues but it’s sad that we had to wait til 2017 to see a gay character. Voyager ran into the 2000s when homosexuality was allowed on TV.

His reasoning (and I believe he is sincere, if a bit deluded) is that is The Federation waits until they actually NEED StarFleet to control Earth it will be too late. Being the Supreme Commander over Earth is also appealing, I'm sure.

Of course, Sisko and Odo uncover the plot and end it before Layton can take over, and they are right to do so. But I can't help but wonder - **Would the Dominion War gone differently had Layton succeeded?** If Earth had become fortified (and suitably paranoid) that early, could the Alpha Quadrant have withstood the Dominion threat better?",DS9 'What If?' scenario,1

Before i start, I just want to say Kes was absolutely one of my favorite characters. I knew she left the show at some point, and at first, it didn't bother me. This all changed once I started season 3 and I was blown away. Kes became an amazing character. I think she should've been left on an M class planet and remained in touch with Tuvok. Once she regained control of her powers, she could've come back. I know it wouldn't 100% work, but it would've been better in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just started the Year in Hell two parter, and it feels wrong without Kes. Ignoring the whole Jennifer Lein got fired or quit controversy, I understand why Kes isn't there (to some extent). Kes and Tom got married and Janeway and B'Elanna die in the alternate version. If Kes survived, there's a chance those same events would've occurred, but that does not make it absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys haven't heard, the original idea was for the Year in Hell to be an arc spanning a few episodes (like the Dominion War in the last season of DS9). Since Lein decided not to renew her contract, the idea was scrapped. Personally, I think they should have gone with the arc idea. It would've made the danger more real (if that makes sense). I think part of why they didn't was because Berman was one of the producers, and he hated the Dominion War arc.

"Star Trek Valiant:  The ***Valiant*** was a ship that was launched soon after First Contact. She was one of the first warp drive deep space explorers.  The *Valiant* encountered a magnetic storm and was knocked off course; it was swept into the Galactic Barrier. Contact with the barrier resulted in the death of six crew members, and led to the mutation of the chief engineer into a super-human. As his powers began to grow he killed several security guards, and the captain had no choice but to destroy his own ship.

"Love it or loathe it, Discovery is at least here for a 2nd series. 

Personally, I like the show but it took a 2nd binge watch on Netflix to get there. However, it has many many issues that just do not fit with Trek cannon.  Now....I could nit pick each and every issue but I'm just going to focus on the one major issue in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Warning: Spoilers ahead! 

&amp;#x200B;

The Spore drive! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...I like the idea of the Spore drive. It's interesting, opens up numerous possibilities.....but so help me it spits in the face of all other Trek.  I'm just going to put this in perspective for a moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Federation (or at least Stamets) makes an engine that allows Discovery to go anywhere in the universe in the blink of an eye using the  *mycelial network* which inhabits subspace. Obviously it has issues as we learn in the show (mostly caused by Lorca) but it's viable. Used correctly and  sparingly, you can jump to any location in the universe. Hammer and abuse it and then it's not only reality hopping but time hopping as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, it's not something we ever heard of in later Trek shows. You would think Janeway would have risked making and using one to get home. You'd even think that the Federation would adopt Spore drives when it's found that Warp travel is collapsing subspace in TNGs  ""Force of Nature"" episode. You can also be damn sure the Borg would give their left nipple nut for Spore Drive tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...the easy hand wave scenario here is that the Spore Drive is abandoned and / or classified after whatever events take place in Discovery. Again, this makes no sense. The Federation knows it works  (it was their secret weapon against the Klingon's) and they know Lorca subverted it by keying in false co-ordinates under extreme circumstances to jump to the mirror universe (something they more than happily classified). We also know it jumped 9 months forward in time coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

So something has to happen for the Federation to 100% lock it down and classify it as unsafe and unusable during TOS and TNG era.  Thats the end result from the show (it has to be) and to me, it would be sad to see those sort of possibilities be removed from the Trek universe.  

&amp;#x200B;

So..I think the solution is easy.  Throw Discovery and key supporting cast members (say...Mirror  Georgiou, Tyler and  [L'Rell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/characters/nm2371448?ref_=tt_cl_t12)  through time to a post Nemesis era.....say..20 years after and never EVER let them go back. Have it so the crew was assumed lost by the Federation + Klingon's  after their final Spore jump post TOS era with events that actually lead to the spore drive being classified and abandoned.  Maybe even have it so Picard is the one bringing them up to date. Eitherway, the crew can come back into the service of a newer Star Fleet / Klingon's whilst dealing with the loss of their family's. Maybe even have Worf bringing L'Rell up to date. The ship maybe gets a few minor overhall's (like a proper Holodeck) but is deemed sound enough to go back into exploratory service whilst Starfleet can re-open up the Spore drive for new shows.

&amp;#x200B;

If push really comes to shove, they can even use the Spore drive to resolve the Kelvin universe issue. Just needs some clever writing (since it seems unlikely to be resolved now).  

&amp;#x200B;

Eitherway...the Spore Drive is the problem and needs fixing without being abandoned imo.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a thought anyway.

"Of course, I wouldn't want the Klingon's to look like they do in Star Trek Discovery. I'd prefer they look like they did in DS9 &amp; TNG. I'd also prefer this show look similar to the style of TNG &amp; DS9.

They could delve deep into Klingon culture, the wars they went through, their traditions, rituals, strengths, weaknesses and all the bad ass things Klingons do.  Then of course, add tons of hot Klingon women with the cleavage and everything.  Battles, rough sex, war, that'd be awesome. Then we'd get to bear witness to the Klingon perspective when they deal with the federation and other cultures.  That'd be so interesting.

When Klingons receive a distress call from a planet from another race/culture that's in need, what would Klingons do?  Do they ever help those in need? If so, how? Do they coddle them or challenge them to make them stronger?

"Okay this is going into the holodeck which is just a whole kettle of cans of worms, but I had a thought.

We know Neelix was given a set of temporary holo-lungs. We know that people eat/drink and possibly even choke on smoke. So we know the replication of holo products is almost perfect.

Now taking inspiration from that weird line in ""blink of an Eye"", imagine a future where, a Woman lost her husband before they had kids, and she had sex with a holo-representation of her husband.

Now obviously everything about him is a holorecreation, but! Say she conceived in the holodeck and stayed in there for most, if not all, of the term. Assuming she only ate food from outside the holoeck her body would create a child using both her own and a holo-representation of her husbands DNA.

Now this child, would only have 1/2 of a cells worth of DNA that was now Holographic. The rest would have been made by the mother based on the original, due to cellular Mitosis.

Now say the woman steps out of the Holodeck with her child, it might suffer very slight cell death in a few hundred cells. But a baby is still developing and can compensate for that (not to mention future medical tech)

"So we know from the DS9 episode “Accession” that if a planet has a caste system of any kind, it is considered ineligible for membership to the federation. So what do you think happens to planets that meet all the technological and political requirements, but still discriminate against certain members of its population?




Let’s use the Vissians as an example. Their only appearance in the franchise was in the Enterprise episode “Cogenitor.” I’ve brought this episode up before, mainly because it infuriates me to no end (which might become apparent here.) I’m going to assume you’ve already seen the episode and are familiar with its contents. After watching it recently, I couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if the Vissians later applied for membership in the federation.




Imagine you’re a Vissian. Your civilization has practiced a form a sexual slavery for as long as your history records. It’s so accepted on your planet that no one ever questions it. One day, your planet’s government applies for membership into the Federation of Planets, the most powerful organization in the Alpha **and** Beta quadrants, with solid footholds in Delta and Gamma. Membership means security for your people, both on and off-world, a voice in galactic affairs, and access to the combined knowledge of thousands of unique civilizations.


Then it gets rejected.


And the reason why is made perfectly clear. The federation finds your treatment of the Cogenitors backwards and barbaric. Maybe they don’t say it like that, but they say it. So what does the average Vissian think now? Quintillion’s of people all looked at your society and said without hesitation “that’s backwards, barbaric, and wrong.” Does that give you pause?




The closest real life example of what I’m trying to describe would be apartheid. Most of the countries on earth utterly condemned what the South African government was doing to its black citizens. I’ve wondered before what it was like to be a supporter of apartheid at that time. The entire rest of the planet is telling you you’re the bad guy, how can you go on thinking that what you’re doing is right?



I’m sorry, this turned into another rant about an episode I’ve already ranted about multiple times. But at least this time, I’ve asked a question that I hope people on this this sub will find somewhat interesting.","I’m really sorry, but I have to rant about “Cogenitor” again...",1

But wait... that doesn't actually sound like fun. Nothing really exciting happened at the time, after all. They failed to crack the code of their language, nor was there any mention of a conflict. How would they give us an interesting episode without violating canon?

You make it the B plot, that's how. Put the focus of the episode on something else: crew relationships, recent events, some mundane problem that serves as a substrate for character development. First contact is one of those things that's seen as a big deal and they make whole episodes revolving around the clash of cultures and so on, but I find something amusingly appealing about doing a first contact episode where it's treated as just another day at the office. They spend a few hours trying to get to know these bizarre aliens who love their proper nouns so much, but eventually have to just give up before they say something offensive. Shaka, when the walls fell.

That would all be in the background. Most of the screen time would be about, I don't know, Burnham and Tilly debugging the translator and musing about the vagaries of life in space. I think it could really work as a breather episode. You know the kind I mean, like ""Captain's Holiday"" or ""In The Cards"". Something lighthearted to break up the more serious episodes.

"As much as I love TOS, as much as I love TOS's unique aesthetic style that no other series has attempted to mimic (even when it really should), TOS just doesn't fit anymore.

Aesthetics aside, TOS has aged horribly on social issues. Yes, it was extremely progressive for its time *race wise* but its treatment of women was still rather appalling -- and note that TNG, DS9, even VOY and ENT also suffered from this in some respect. And to say that the Federation of TOS could even possibly be just 10 years after the significantly more progressive Federation of Discovery would be utterly insane.

Moving on from socio-political issues, TOS (and its sequel, TAS) also diverges from the rest of Trek canon significantly in many places. In ""Balance of Terror"" the Enterprise seems to fire phasers like torpedoes, and apparently requires a special ""Phaser Control"" room where crew members fire the weapons manually. Given that we see nothing like this in ENT, DIS, or anything that comes after TOS, this is a technical inconsistency. At another point, the Enterprise travels 1,000 lightyears at ordinary warp within just a few days -- Voyager could've gotten home much faster if that's how fast the *original* Enterprise could go. And there are many more that I could list but I want to avoid making a novel out of this.

Now, moving on to aesthetic issues. As much as I love the TOS aesthetic and think DIS should have respected it more, it should be noted that this aesthetic provides one of the biggest eyebrow-raising issues in all of TOS: Everything looks the same.
It would be one thing if the memorable TOS style was unique to Starfleet ships, but we see over the course of the series that Klingon ships, Romulan ships, ""Alien of the week"" ships, and even ancient human vessels like the Botany Bay all follow this aesthetic -- even though these are all vastly different cultures and situations behind construction, how do they look the same? That, along with the fact that many of the races we would later see in TNG and ENT appear in the stereotypical TOS makeup, even though later on the Klingons *and* Romulans would get their forehead ridges.
What this shows is that TOS doesn't really take itself seriously in many ways. We're supposed to suspect our disbelief that the aliens look like humans in light makeup and that all the interior scenes are made using recycled props and re-dressed sets and thus all look like they were built by the same race. And we're supposed to just ignore the countless glaring continuity errors, events that contradict later canon, and stories that should never have been written at all (Spock's Brain, anyone?). Within the larger scheme of the Star Trek cinematic universe, TOS is a trainwreck of errors that, though charming in its dated nature, and sentimentally valuable to fans, is doing more harm than good overall.

So here's what I suppose: CBS should declare the Original Series and its animated Spinoff to be in an alternate timeline of its own. Then they should reboot TOS as a modern show, they could pick out things to keep, and things to leave behind. Famous *good* episodes could be redone from the original script with only slight tweaks to fit better in canon, fix any politically ""sketchy"" material, and use the modern budget and effects to more closely achieve the original writer's original intentions for the episode (which they usually had to cut down), meaning we could have episodes like ""Balance of Terror"" ""City on the Edge of Forever"" ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""All our Yesterdays"" redone with stunningly beautiful sets and effects, and vastly more expansive scopes. Stories that could've been good or were good, but were written poorly, could be thus rewritten to achieve their true potential. As well as entirely new episodes to replace the ones that are completely irretrievable -- imagine replacing ""Turnabout Intruder"" with something awesome. And let's not forget that TAS, too, had some good episodes. Those episodes could be remade in stunningly beautiful live-action.

This sort of change wouldn't be for everyone, of course. There are a lot of TOS purists who would rather have *everything else* declared non-canon so TOS could shine on its own. But I think that, by placing TOS and TAS in their own alternate timeline, CBS could ensure that both original shows remain canon, but separately from the rest -- this, I hope, would satisfy both sides of the aisle.

There would, still, be some issues reconciling such a change with larger Trek canon. As shows like ""Relics"", ""Trials and Tribble-ations"", and ""In a Mirror Darkly"" all feature TOS heavily. But it is possible that modern VFX could edit each one to fit the rebooted show, and that the updated version could come out with, say, a 60th anniversary remaster -- note that this would mean TNG, DS9, and ENT would all be getting remastered.

On a final note, such a rebooted show need not start with Kirk. We could instead start with a remake of ""The Cage"" and go for a few seasons of Anson Mount's Pike before making the switch to Kirk -- this would, I imagine, cool the tempers of some fans by letting them get into the show while it was covering unexplored territory, which would make it easier for them to accept the eventually paving-over of TOS. Perhaps a seven-season run would be good -- two seasons for Pike's command, the episodes spread out over a long time span and another five for Kirk's famous Five Year Mission.

Anyway, what do you think? Should TOS be separated from Prime Canon? Would you watch such a reboot show? Do you think CBS would make a good show out of the reboot, Or would they fudge it terribly?

Edit: Well, the DIS hate here is rather astonishing. And the fact that, when faced with glaring inconsistencies in a story, everybody goes ""who cares, it's fictional"" is very disappointing to me as an amateur writer. If these people wrote TV shows, there would probably be no continuity at all.

Also, I must further remind you people that I'm talking about giving TOS it's own timeline to live in, separate from TNG. By doing this, you instantly resolve most of the inconsistencies in Trek canon without removing anything from canon. TOS remains canon, but in the same way that the Kelvin timeline is canon -- perhaps even with a point of divergence established. It also opens up the chance for us to relive some of the better moments of TOS with superior effects and improved production quality via the remake.","It's sad, but TOS needs to go in order for Trek canon to fit more smoothly.",1

"Let me pose a hypothetical question. 

Can Data be cloned?

Let's say I were to take the basic Star Trek transporter technology and combine it with their replicator technology to create a machine that can clone any object. Put an item in the transporter and it gets transported from one pad to another. The object is turned into a massive amount of data in the pattern buffer. That data is sent to the other pad where the transporter rematerialized the item. 

At the same time, what if that same information in the pattern buffer was sent to a replicator? The replicator uses the information to create that same object. And there you go, you have an original sitting on the transporter pad and a replica sitting in the replicator.

Now who knows if you could use such a theoretical machine on a person. Whatever comes out of the replicator might be a living breathing person...or it could be a lifeless pile of organic tissue. That's a discussion for another time, but what about Data? 

He's a machine. So whatever comes out of the replicator, would be an exact clone. Either it could be an exact duplicate with all of data's memories in tact, or it would be a technical replica only. A completely clean, brand new positronic brain that is ready to either be dissected so they could figure out how it works, or ready to be programmed with a new personality. ""An android on every ship"" as they wanted in the episode where Data was declared a sentient being.

"Ahoy hoy fellow Trekkies and Trekkers!

We've decided to run a little experiment. As our sub has grown and grown over the last year (at the moment we're averaging around 100 new subscribers a day!), we've started to feel like it's become less like a community and more like a bunch of strangers getting together to talk about something they're interested in. Which is fine, but we'd like to bring back a bit of that family feeling and get to know each other a bit better.

So we will be trying out having an ""off topic"" post, pinned to the top of the sub for a day or so every week, where users can gather, have a tall glass of prune juice or Romulan Ale, and talk about how things are going and what you're doing/looking forward to/cooking/playing/watching. Depending on how it goes and the schedules for the new Trek shows, it might move around the week a bit (and because Ten Forward Tuesday sounds better tbh).

"I've never bothered to watch Enterprise before as I heard it was the worst series and the theme music did my head in.  However with little to watch on Netflix, I gave it try number 5.

And boy was I stupid.  I love this series.  Just on season 1 episode 18ish at the moment but so much about it is great.  The pre Federation Starfleet,  the submarine like design of the ship, dealing with recoil when they fired their first laser cannon, a story stretched across a season,  the experienced Boomers vs inexperienced Starfleet dynamic, the Vulcan perspective.   Even the characters - Archer is a brilliant captain.  He's moral but unsure about it, curious but cautious, desperate to prove himself and his species to the galaxy.  Wildly entertaining and highly relatable.  The Doctor is a charming character as are Trip and Malcolm in their own way.  Lewis seems to be the Wesley or Harry of this series but I can handle that.

"TOS has a great first and arguably second season, but a lacklustre third.

TNG has terrible first and second seasons. Yes, there are a few gems, but fifty-two, hour-long episodes is a slog to get through for only a handful of decent ones. Season three to seven, however, are my personal favourite Trek.

DS9 also starts slow yet the first and second seasons are actually watchable. Season three to seven are also amazing Trek and arguably tied with TNG for the best. Duet is my favourite Trek episode of all time.

VOY is fine with some gems. It’s standout seasons are four and five, but the others are still good and perfectly watchable. My favourite part of VOY is Elite Force.

ENT is half and half. The first two seasons are fine with some gems and the final two seasons are great. Just be sure to stop watching at the second to last episode. Terra Prime is a much better finale than These are the Voyages

Wouldn’t it be much wiser if they just don’t holster their phasers in the first place when beaming away? Of course, this would only apply in certain situations that call for it. That’s one less step for them to take and it’s much safer security-wise.

"I might be in the minority on this, unfortunately (downvotes off the starboard bow!), but I'm curious to see. I think it could be great. They really do need to reduce the budgets of these movies--they're never going to be billion dollar blockbusters--and if an already wealthy man can't understand that, get rid of him. It would send a message to other rich actors who think they're too big for their britches. I mean how greedy can you be? 

Every setback can be an opportunity. It's a fantastical science fiction world after all, they can do anything. This is a chance to do something weird like, as I've seen many suggest, a transporter accident that ages him into William Shatner, or a body swap into another Trek alum like Jeffrey Combs... or why not Jeri Ryan? She's already proven to be fantastic at that as we saw from the time the Doctor was uploaded into Seven of Nine. I have no problem seeing a known Trek actor take on another role, hell, Combs did that plenty of times. It could be really fun seeing Kirk, a known womanizer, having to deal with the looks and attention he gets from the crew, dealing with the issues that women have to contend with, like men not wanting to take orders from her, or encountering a male dominated sexist society that they have to work with to achieve a goal. Maybe he suddenly finds the skirts the women wear objectifying (I'm sure he would feel very uncomfortable in one of those) and changes the uniforms. Yes, they already did a male/female swap with Kirk in Turnabout Intruder, but that was awful. You can still get the Kirk charisma and rapport with the crew with a different actor. They could get a great, modern sci-fi writer like NK Jemisin to write the screenplay.

I hope they abandon the 'Kirk meets his Dad' story anyway, that sounds like a terrible idea. Just go back to the drawing board and create something new and in the spirit of Star Trek: smart, thought-provoking science fiction. ",I wish they would make Trek 4 without Chris Pine,1

"I really wanted to like this show but in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, I was very disappointed and even angry at it. It does, however carry name Star Trek and so I gave it several chances and midway through the season I found it to be tolerable, even likable. Did it ever “feel” like Star Trek to me? No, but I thought perhaps it could in time.

And then I watched the last few episodes. My God what a mess. Twists for shock value, for the sake of having twists. It felt like the show had no idea where it was going with it. I was woefully disappointed like I had been during the first episode.

The sad thing is the show has AMAZING characters. Saru, Tilly, Lorca were all well-developed and well acted. Seriously stellar performances from those actors. We could have further explored their motivations and personalities. Instead we got shitty plot twists that make no sense.

And then what they did with Lorca...so immensely disappointing. He was complex, driven, gritty. A wartime Starfleet captain whose ends justify the means. A Star Trek antihero.

And they took that idea and shattered it with a dumb plot twist.

To me Star Trek has always been exploring the human condition with a view towards the future seen in a positive light. Maybe that’s just me favoring TNG but that’s what it’s always been for me. This show was nothing like that. It felt empty and soulless. In these crazy times I think we need a little less dystopia and a lot more TNG. A lot more Picard.

And yet it makes me really nervous about the new Picard show. ",I’m sorry but I found Trek: Discovery horrible,1
"I'm a long time Star Trek fan, but I should note that this mainly included TOS and TNG. I grew up watching TOS reruns and the films as a kid and watched all of TNG from start to finish during its initial run. I watched the first season and part of the second of DS9, but lost interest in it a bit, and due to life changes (graduating from high school, joining the military, getting married, etc.) I just never got back into watching Star Trek while any series were still around.

Fast forward a couple of decades, and about two years ago I decided to start watching DS9, as I finally had the time and the means to do so (thanks Netflix!). Although I took a long break from it in the middle of the series, I just now finished watching it in its entirety. Oh boy, what I missed from back in the day. DS9 most certainly belongs in the pantheon of great Star Trek series.

However, this has all left me with a bit of a conundrum. I haven't seen much of Voyager or Enterprise beyond a handful of episodes of each. Although I've seen no episodes of Voyager that I've liked (beyond the pilot), Enterprise held my attention the little that I've been able to see of it. Of course, knowing how Star Trek series tend to go, you can't judge a whole series by just a couple of episodes.

So, this all leads me to my question. Which series should I watch next, Voyager or Enterprise?

Sisko is going hyper-minigolfing with Jake and Kasidy. Dukat decides the Pah-Wraiths want him to ruin Sisko’s day. 

He disguises himself as Kai Winn to get close to Sisko and stab him. But all the Bajorans are crowding him at the minigolf, because they think he’s kai winn. Sisko notices a ruckus in the background but thinks nothing of it. Dukat is stymied and yells his new catchphrase “those accursed Bajorans!”.  No one thinks it’s weird, because that’s very normal behavior for Kai Winn. (Dukat remains in the Kai’s clothes the whole episode, but from this point on they get dirtier and more torn each time we see him.)

Dukat goes to get some Bajoran crocogators from the water area of the golf course. He sneakily sprays some crocogator bait on Sisko’s golf club. But Dukat’s holding the bottle backwards! He gets covered in the spray, and the gators attack him. He repeats his catchphrase. 

It’s the 18th hole, a windmill. Dukat is hiding on the other side of the windmill, so he can replace Sisko’s ball with an exploding one. Right as the ball comes through the windmill, the spinny part catches his underwear. He is lifted into the air with a gigantic wedgie. Sisko gets a hole in one. “Those accursed Bajoran’s!”

The minigolf owners take the Emissary’s hole in one as a sign from the Prophets. They arrange a big feast. Dukat gets a cold fusion drilling machine. He’s going to undermine the foundations of the Feast Hall and kill everyone inside. 

He takes a wrong turn and gets out of the drill to investigate. He’s in the maintenance shed! One of the workers left a bunch of rakes lying around. Dukat stumbles from one to the other, getting hit in the face by each one.

"I just discovered this on Youtube, would never really consider myself one to watch fan films (besides Axanar, which I love), but Star Trek Continues is amazing.

Okay, sure, I've seen some complain about the acting but come on.

"I've always kind of ignored Enterprise. Recently I decided I'd give it another go (couldn't be worse than DISCO).

I started with the first season and I liked some episodes in there. For some reason Terra Nova has the most detailed showing of an alien species in any Star Trek episode, or am I crazy? Haven't seen that often that we see such a detailed culture in a one-episode species (although they weren't even aliens). A lot of Enterprise plots seem to revolve about Archer getting captured though. Then Reed wants to shoot up the place, but they decide for another plan. Other plots revolve around T'Pol looking extremely pissed off (the episode with the rape-hippie-Vulcans being the climax).

Enterprise got kind of formulaic, so I skipped a lot of season 2.
Season 3 was amazing though. They got that really right with the constant threat of the Expanse, being pretty much isolated from other ships and the main arc was pretty solid. I liked the mystery of the spheres. The characters finally got to shine and many got through an evolution. Watching DISCO before this, I think they tried to achieve something similar with DISCO S1 (but failed IMO). 

Enterprise managed to have a great main arc and great single episodes. DISCO didn't achieve both. 

But now for the bad things in ENT S3:

- Too much time travel. We have single plots about time travel, the main arc is heavily time travel influenced and I think that's just a bad writing element. Archer heard of the Federation before founding it, so who really invented it? At least we get T'Pol in a driveway tho

- The finale was amazing imo. The crew is at the end of their powers and want to return home. But no: THEY TIME TRAVELED

- Ultimately this could have played after Voyager or whenever. The crew has some minor problems because it's so early in Star travel but this doesn't make too much of a difference. Vortexes get introduced and this seems like post-warp-technology... We also get a planet-destroying weapon... So lots of advanced technology.

Captain Archer, newly retired from the Enterprise is beamed aboard the ship as it departs. Archer awakes, finding himself trapped in the past, wearing a portable holographic projector generating faces that are not his own, driven by a temporal prime directive to change history for the better.  His only guide on this journey is AI, a future version of an E.C.H., who appears in the form of a hologram.

"So in the episode Voyager becomes divided into several time frames. Go to one area of the ship and your back before the caretaker, go to a different area and your during Seska’s siege of the ship. Well at the end when they get all of the pieces put back together, how is it that Chakotay is the only one with full recollection of the event? All of them had the same antidote as he so that they could cross time frames. The only explanation is that because they merged back as one in the time he’s from that some how that makes him special. However the plan totally depended on him having intact memory of the event to configure the deflector dish when he returns so that the temporal accident never occurs. How did they know for sure that he would remember? There’s no way of knowing that. Also how did they know for sure that he’d be dumped off before the accident occurred? I might just assume that it would dump him back off at the moment it happened.

Also one final question, why would telling Janeway about what happened go against the temporal prime directive? The event was wiped from continuity so he wouldn’t be spoiling anything by telling her.

But I suspect that the first Omega explosion also caused the Mycelial network to collapse/die. Since the Omega molecule damages subspace, and the Mycelial network exists in subspace, it wouldn't be that far fetched to assume that the first Omega explosion on the Starfleet research station caused a subspace chain reaction that spread through the Mycelial network neutralizing it.

"First, let me say that as a lifelong fan, I actually really dig the Starfleet we see in Discovery. It's gritty and sharp. But it doesn't mesh well with the Constitution-style ships that defined the TOS era. Why the difference?

I think there's an assumption in Trek fandom that ships evolve with technology. The Galaxy-class is so much bigger than the Constitution because we eventually figured out how to make a ship that big. The saucers are swept because it was somehow more useful than the blockier versions of the past.

I don't think this is necessarily the case. 

Three things affect starship design: Technology, Requirement, and Stylistic Choice.

**Tech**

Yes, tech advancement certainly comes into play. Mostly with the engines, I'd assume. But this wouldn't explain why things get bigger. As tech advances, it usually gets smaller. The difference between the size of the Sovereign nacelle and an Intrepid nacelle are huge, and yet their top speeds are pretty comparable. A Nova class is tiny, but still goes pretty fast. The engines have to be sufficient to deal with the size of the ship.

The STO explanation for why the Sovereign and Vesta are so narrow is because the slipstream tunnel they can utilize takes much less energy to sustain if it's got a smaller diameter, but tech advancements really take a back seat to the requirements for the ship.

**Requirement**

Constitutions are smaller than a Crossfield (which I suspect is an advanced refit of a much older ship), because they should be. They're battle-cruisers designed to take on a D7. They're no frills. They need to be quick and sustainable. Galaxies are huge because they're deep space explorers designed to house a small city of families. It's a peacetime ship. When a wartime ship is needed, the Sovereign offers a smaller, more compact target, fewer weak points, like the vulnerable neck, etc, and yet is large enough to transport armies, escort convoys, stand in line of battle, and handle the firepower it's got without shaking itself apart.

When we watch Discovery, what are we looking at? We're looking at a Starfleet that's about 100 years old, and has been more or less at peace throughout that time. Ask any grunt what the peacetime quality of their equipment is, and it sucks. Remember in the Iraq war when stories came out of soldiers strapping hunks of metal to their transports as extra armor because they didn't have modern available armor. Rumsfeld said ""You go to war with the army you have,"" and he was right. Peacetime forces generally run on old equipment and tech. These ships are old. They're explorer craft. They're not designed for war. And in Disco they're getting destroyed at a fast clip. Meanwhile they're building Connies, a war ship. Mirandas, a war ship. Someone's drawing early designs for the Excelsior on a cocktail napkin right about now. I'm betting these will be phased out, and we'll see newer, more recognizable ships phase in.

**Style**

Humans are artistic, probably more than we're practical. When we see these ships, we're looking at stylistic zeitgeists of the time. The Disco ships are art deco. Bronze coloring, straight, overlapping lines, engines in sharp points. Do they NEED to be like that? Probably not. But somewhere on Earth is a head designer of San Francisco Fleetyards who's signature style was art deco starships. And some young buck whose sensibilities steer toward Atomic Era design is coming in. ""Hey, why not round nacelles and military gray?""  


Style doesn't evolve, it just changes. Brutalist architecture is hundreds of years more advanced than Gothic architecture but one is hardly the evolved form of the other. Starfleet had an Art Deco era, and Atomic Era, a Militaristic Era, an Organic Era, etc. And they'll change again.",My take on Discovery Era ships,1

"This is going to push your star trek knowledge so bear with me.

I was thinking about Commander Data, and how even though he is a fantastic technical design that was basically one of a kind (besides Lore and B4 if you have to count him).  He was the culmination of a scientists dream who wanted to make a being who would learn and better himself through experience as Data had even though Soong knew himself that he (Soong) was flawed.  

Then I remembered the TOS episode I Mudd.  The android Norman I think seemed even more complex.  He had desires and ambitions, and the idea that he and his android race were needed to “take care of humans” by serving them.  Norman was of course defeated by Kirk and Company.

Two very different androids to say the least.

The thing I just thought about though is that there were no references to the remaining androids.  What do you think happened to them.  Kirk mentioned that they reverted back to their original programming of geological work and they were tasked to also keep Harry Mudd out of space (with a bunch of X wife androids).

Does anyone wonder what happened to the rest of the androids?  There is no reason to assume they wouldn’t be functioning during the time of Data.

"If there’s one thing Star Trek fans love to do, it’s speculate. How does this thingababob work?  How does a species have a language based on stories, with no way to explain what individual words mean?  How functional is Data?

So it stands to reason that speculation hits a fever pitch when they announce a new show with the return of Picard. People have been dying for a return to the post-TNG era, and we’re finally going to get it. 

But some seem to think this will be something of a sequel to the old shows:

“Picard is living with Vash on an empty planet, working at an archaeological site. Captain Nog shows up with his holographic first Officer, Vic Fontaine. They join Geordi and Seven of Nine on an adventure with the Traveler to rescue Sisko from the wormhole. The only thing that stands in their way is a team of Dukat, Species 8472, and Sela. Garak arrives on the Titan, but can he be trusted?  Only HoloData as the ship’s computer can say for sure!”

I think the ties to past shows will only happen in passing. CBS isn’t going to launch a new show that’s dependent on someone having seen 700+ episodes of older shows. 

I imagine there will be little Easter eggs and cameos here and there to make us happy, but they’re not going to make past events pivotal pieces of the plot. They’ll want this new show to be open for new viewers — people who only have a passing knowledge of TNG and the other shows — and they’re certainly not going to want to bog it down with lengthy scenes of exposition where they explain storylines from 30 years ago. 

Personally, I’ll just be happy to see Picard back on the screen. As long as he rips into someone with a speech about ethics and morals, I’ll count it as a success. ",Why the new Picard show will not involve a mission to save Sisko,1

"Feeling inspired by the recent Troi's thread, I'd like to share my own idea about an issue in Voyager existing since the original run of the show. 
When I first watched the series I was little more than a kid and had almonst an obsession with the Borg. 
When Seven joined I was ecstatic (a Borg character who isn't a villain *and* is an attractive woman? 10/10 for my brain). 

Soon though it bothered me to no end that she didn't wear a uniform. At first it was because I simply like uniforms and having Seven wearing one would feel like she was truly part of the crew and later, growing up, also because I felt Seven would have tried to mix with the Voyager crew to feel once again in a group of identical individuals. 

I disliked the fact that the Maquis started wearing uniforms, a symbol of what they were fighting, while the lone ex-Borg striving for a collective would wear a pretty unique and revealing one piece. 

I would have loved Seven wearing a uniform, exploring the ideas that wearing the same outfit of your colleagues brings and her bonding with the crew. 

The fanservice aspect could have been kept in particular scenes, there would be quite a few ways to insert some eye candy moments without having Jeri Ryan wear a skintight for the whole series (I'm not against fanservice per se, but I prefer it to be the exception in a show and to be used only when the context is sound. Also fanservice with men isn't a bad idea).

I was rewatching *The Drumhead* the other night.  It gives me chills how eerily prescient the episode was, and depressingly so given that it used our past as inspiration.   But there is a tidbit that is often overlooked.  A morsel that is hidden behind the feast of Picard’s speech and Admiral Satie.   


J’Dan.  A rarity in TNG era Klingons.  First, a scientist.  The is sadly a job that is way underrepresented in our dealing with Klingons.  After all, they do have to have brilliant minds to design and maintain their amazing ships. 


He does not dress in the typical Klingon fashion, perhaps due to his extended exchange with the Federation.  Kurn still wore his uniform, but perhaps J’Dan was never a member of the KDF.   Still, a Klingon in civilian clothes and wearing a *Federation* combadge is an unusual sight. 


Third, he is a spy.  He appear to be working with the Romulans, but also has (or claims) high connections in Klingon society.  (I am glad they didn’t explicitly link him to the Duras family). Klingon Intelligence is mentioned and seen on DS9, and TOS has a couple examples of Klingon spies. But TNG didn’t as much. 


He has one very key line that made me think of his place in the overarching Klingon story:


J'DAN: The blood of all Klingons has become water. Since the Federation alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies. Romulans are strong. They are worthy allies. They do not turn Klingons into weaklings like you. 



It is almost as if he believes that the Federation will corrupt, has corrupted the Empire, yet with the Romulans they will “Remain Klingon”.  



T’Kuvma’s belief was nothing new in DSC, but perhaps just the earliest chronological appearance.  


T’Kuvma. Chang. J’Dan. All trying in their own way to recapture glory days that perhaps never were...

Now, of course it doesn't have to be an on-screen relationship, there's been no announcement about any other TNG co-stars apart from Stewart on the show, but it could be a character detail that's kept off-screen, opening up the possibility of Picard being married to Crusher, Vash, Lower Decks Commander, Insurrection older woman or, shock horror, someone original. 

I guess the TL;DR question I'm asking here is: Do you want Picard to be exactly the same, buttoned down, socially awkward singleton he was in TNG, or perhaps slightly more open in that regard to be able to hold down a relationship?",Would You Like Picard To Be Married in His New Show?,1

He enjoys creating chaos, he loves to test and challenge human nature in greed, pain, and distress. He’s smart and charming, he’s lovable and obnoxious, highly whimsical and will never comply to any law or regulation (not even Continuum ones).

"I didn't like Star Trek until watching TNG in college.  I then watched all of TNG, DS9, and Voyager in the course of about a year.

It seemed like it was just going to be cheesy and bad.  Hokey stories with overly dramatic Shatner...ACTING.

I finally decided that for being such a Star Trek fan, it is a shame that I've never seen the Original series. I decided to grin and bear it and just ""get through"" the original.  Wow! Was I wrong! It is great so far.  

I am not terribly far in.  I just finished ""Mudd's Women"".  I am amazed at how restrained Shatner's Kirk is in most of it.  He's fantastic. Magnetic.  Also, the stories are all really great too!

**Star Trek: The British Generation** — Experience the thrills of Star Trek: The Next Generation all over again in exactly the same way, but recast with British sitcom actors and stand-ups. Starring Matt Berry as Commander Riker, Noel Fielding as Data, and Richard Ayoade as Geordi La Forge. Picard, having already been played by an Englishman, will instead be played by Bryan Cranston. Runs for 18 episodes over three series.

**Teen Worf** — Earth, 2357. Worf is the lamest nerd at Earth High. Shunned by the cool Racquetball jocks and the preppy Vulcan teens alike, Worf has only one dream: proving his honour to Becky Wieztman, his crush, by defeating the dishonourable p'taQ from Andoria High in personal combat/dance party. With his parents off-planet for the weekend, can Worf finally host the coolest house party/deathmatch of the summer *and* win the affections of the girl he loves?

**Quark's House Party** — Quark invites celebrities into his home every week for interviews, games, quizzes and hijinks, accompanied as always by his mischievous cohort, Mr Sluggy. Will be cancelled after just one season when celebrities refuse to pay the admission fee.

**Dad Cop!** — After getting stranded in 1996 Los Angeles (VOY S3E09/10), Commander Chakotay gives up his life as a starship officer for good. Armed only with his complete lack of personality and [the most boring fucking suit the mid-90s has to offer](https://janewayobsession.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futuresend6.jpg), Chakotay becomes ...

**The Original Series Retrospective: The Series** — Stars of the original series of Star Trek relive and re-enact their experiences as we revisit classic moments from the 1966 series. Of course, since a lot of the original cast are long retired or sadly passed, they'll be replaced with their counterparts from the JJ Abrams Star Trek movies.

"I did a rewatch of TOS while listening to the Mission Log podcast, then decided it was time to keep going and take the plunge on TAS. I'd never felt a burning need to watch it, but at the same time - it's Star Trek, and it's new to me!

I can see both why it's worth watching and why so many people skip it.

The good: The plots are very Star Trek-y, but without the bloat that made some episodes feel like they took forever to get anywhere. ""Yesteryear"" fills in a lot of Spock's backstory, and ""More Tribbles, More Trouble"" is basically ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" without the INTERMINABLE bar fight. Even the episodes that are just okay have both a lot to chew on philosophically and entertainment value.

The bad: The animation is really dated and cheap looking. There's no way around it, and you just have to accept it if you're going to watch. The voice work is also really stiff, as if nobody is talking to anyone else - likely because the cast was rarely together to record. There are also weird continuity errors and a tendency to make up technobabble to fill in gaps in the stories.

Overall, it's worth watching, as long as you know what you're getting in to. Plus at just 22 episodes, it's not much of a time commitment. ",Been a Trek fan for 30 years - and I'm finally watching The Animated Series,1
"Inspired by the recent thread about Garrett's desire for a Voyager movie, here's my idea of how they could have managed it, or perhaps even still could.

Start by deriving some urgent crisis in the Delta quadrant which Starfleet has to respond to.  And logically, what team has the most experience with that region of space and the McGuffin in question? The Voyagers!

This would make for a great addition to the story without having to alter the show.

The first part of the movie could briefly show what everyone had been up to since their return in the short scenes in which Janeway has to ""get the band back together.""  

And add the risk that they may get stuck in the Delta quadrant again; we've managed to jerry-rig some device that can get them there, but it only works from our end so the return plan is dubious and dependent on success.

Janeway is resigned to go, although she has a lot of sighing and eye rolling going along with it.

She recruits Tuvok and Barclay first; they don't hesitate to sign on.  Seven agrees, but not without protest; perhaps there is a specific threat to her.

But no one else is so easy.  Tom and B'Elanna have a family; can they leave their kids? Do they bring them along?  Each agrees that surely they can be replaced, but Janeway always gets her way.  Also, Tom has lost a lot of hair. 

Chakotay agrees, but only because he wants to support Janeway and Seven. Perhaps he protests, but when Seven agrees he acquiesces.
Hacoochimoya. 

Or hell, maybe Seven is lost and in danger in the Delta and that's the inciting action in the first place.

Maybe bringing the Doctor along is only possible if he is resigned to sick bay once again, for some reason they can't take his emitter.  He doesn't like this idea, but he owes everything to his family.  He's a doctor, not a commando.

Kim flat out refuses.  He has a completely perfect life in every way.  It looks like the trip will go without him--until a last minute change of heart has him walk on to the bridge just before departure where he takes a new post since he's a Lt. now.

Maybe they could even run into Neelix upon arrival or find that Kes is involved in the threat. 

Anyway, that's how the movie is setup.  Hell, they could still do it all these years later.

The first 20 minutes could be basically a comedy as Janeway rallies her reluctant crew.

Then they go- and chaos and disaster immediately upon arrival for the next hour when they finally save the day and somehow get home again.  During all of this, the dynamics are different now-the crew is fighting amongst themselves, they all blame each other for various problems and especially Janeway for getting them back into this mess! 

Upon returning home, the crew has patched up their differences and even feel nostalgic for the old days.  Maybe they'll stick together for a while.  Maybe one more adventure...

Voyager 2: The Wrath of Kes

Voyager 3: The Search for Tuvok.

Voyager 4: The Voyage Home...again, but first time traveling and getting whales

Voyager 5:  Janeway beats up God, in the Delta Quadrant 

Voyager 6: The Final Peace accords with..the Borg!? 

I think that CBS recently got the message loud and clear that people want more Trek.  And by year's end they'll merge with Paramount as a ploy to have a more valuable company to eventually get bought by Disney.  So it's not too late!!!

Anyways, do spaceships have doors for people to get on and off the ship, or do they always have to beam on and off the ship?

So when they staff the ships for the first time, does all the crew have to beam on in groups of 5 or 6? Or is there a more efficient way of getting everyone on board?

"roll it back, basically I've been making an effort to watch all the core star Trek series. my first stop off was TNG as it was the one I was most interested in and I've got the box sets of TOS and Enterprise to get to later.

But right now I'm working through voyager and my thoughts;

\-I agree with most that it's certainly one of the weaker series, I think SF debris called it TNG in a new coat of paint and I'm inclined to agree. Though I'd say there are far more enjoyable episodes after season 3.

\-Surprisingly I seem to be at odds with many people about Kes, the show greatly improved with her leaving. Her actress gave a very soft breathy performance and with her telepathic power she was just another Troi only even less important. Her species as well is one of the worst designed for a main character. The only problem with her leaving was that they never seemed to think about replacing her with another nurse, not even a non-speaking one.

\-I think this one is really gonna get me some hate, but I'm actually enjoying Neelix. At least beyond season 3, and even then you can see any Arc there from a bumbling conman with a childish temperament to an actually helpful character.

\-While overdone sometimes, Tuvok is not a bad vulcan, I've seen worse ones in TNG (and I've heard I'll run into many more bad ones in enterprise)

\-I do agree with many of the community that the Doctor and Seven are some of the highlights of the entire show. Though halfway through season 5 I'm already getting repeated stories for seven. And it is a bit annoying when you have you tell people the large titted woman in a tight uniform is one of the better characters and have to wait and see how they take that.

\-The magical repairing ship and the near limitless supply of shuttlecraft is probably one of the biggest weaknesses once you notice it, because once you do, it just can't be ignored.

\-Kazon? bad copy of a klingon

Viddian? Nice idea, almost like an organic version of the borg. But needed more than 3 episodes.

Those hunter aliens-forgot their names because they're less ""predator"" and more ""elmer fudd""

The Garbage scout aliens-a nice idea again, but buried with too few epsiodes and not enough interesting details.

"so this show came out a while back. it was on cbs for its pilot as i watched it on xfinity cable (or started to, i got a phone call and had to pause it). i went back to watch it later on demand but it was gone, no listing, no information, no show page on x1 on demand... just fucking gone. MONTHS went by before i finally found out it seems to not be aired on ANY cable network but is rather online only, who the fuck thought this was a good idea?

so after pirating the show as ill be damned if im going to pay for a show that is on a network i PAY over 200.00 a month to have on xfinity... i am trying to get used to a few things, not bad so far but i would say the show panders too much for my taste. i do not enjoy any show/movie that feels the need to talk its way though every aspect of what is hapening on the screen and it seems thus far anyway, that startrek does this. im only 2 episodes in however so im holding off on final judgments.

however the real reason i came on here was to ask a question, a question about previews. at the end of the 2nd episode there is a 6 minute section that is only marked as separate from the episode in a passing remark about 'still to come in startrek' and then it goes into a reveal of all the fucking plot points in the season? am i just weird or do others despise this type of shit too? I feel angry when someone spoils an ending or give away a plot point and yet all over the movies and tv there seems to be this trend to showing all of the best parts, spoiling all the reveals, and just deflating all the air out of the scripts before they are released?

just a rant from what ive noticed so far

tl;dr  fuck previews

i also do not understand the story arc that some how michael started all this... she is blamed by her captian, starfleet, and the people on the transport she is on in ep3. so she goes to investigate an artifact, while there gets attacked by a klingon and wins, then she tries to attack them but is not allowed to. from how i see it she is only guilty of staying alive. its starfleets policy to not shoot first that is what allowed the war to proceed and it is the klingons fault there is war.  now at the end she goes to the klingon ship to capture the fucking guy and then kills him? i dont get that, seems lazy writing to me. in either case its her fault he may be a maryter now but the war was already started by that point.   

tl;dr, imo everyone yelling she caused the war are spouting bull shit and the writers in no way have explained this line of thought",startrek discovery,1

I can't seem to glean a consistent pattern of usage from the episodes in which dress uniforms are worn. In the wedding scenes, its wear ranges from no one (TOS's ""Balance of Terror"") to only those officiating or part of ""wedding party"" in dress uniform (TNG's ""Data's Day"" and VOY's ""Course: Oblivion"") to all Starfleet personnel in attendance (""Nemesis""). Other scenes are equally mystifying, as it doesn't seem to ever be worn by everyone at a given occasion.

It's also canonical that humans are kind of seen as the leaders of the federation. We often see other races mention Humans first and foremost when talking about the federation.

It is because of humanities desire to be social/friendly with other races that organisations such as the federation are formed. All the other major factions are formed by one species.

"With the recent paycut debacle involving Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth, the future of the Kelvin Timeline films is in jeopardy. Now I know a ton of Trek fans hate those films, but I'm one of the few Trek fans who seem to really like them. They recaptured elements of TOS but mixed in with big screen action. They weren't perfect, but I've enjoyed them and I don't think the Kelvin francise deserves to die. So I have thought of a way to save it (possibly). So here's my idea:

Focus on a new starship and crew. I mean, come on, Kirk and the Enterprise crew can't be the only ones who have had amazing adventures. A new captain and crew on a different ship set at the same time as Chris Pine's Kirk adventures could be a smart move and a chance to start fresh. Maybe Pine or Quinto could be persuaded to appear in a cameo at the beginning or something.

They don't need to follow the adventures of The Enterprise. Look at what they did with Discovery, different ship, different captain, different crew. The Kelvin Timeline needs to learn from Discovery and follow suit.

I would follow the adventures of Matt Decker in the Kelvin Timeline, and I'd cast Mark Ruffalo or Henry Rollins as I feel both those guys would bring something interesting to the role. My idea is that in the Kelvin Timeline, Decker and his crew never encounter the doomsday machine (or it plays out totally different and Decker doesn't lose his crew and go insane) and they continue to have many more adventures on the USS Constellation.

It could also be set around or a little before the events of Star Trek 2009, maybe Bruce Greenwood could reprise his version of Pike briefly. Maybe get JJ Abrams to return in the director's chair, and maybe hire some better writers who can come up with a new Trek script that'll really grab audiences.

"Preface: Dad was a big Trek fan when I was growing up. I was old enough (8 years old) to remember watching the TNG series finale with him. I watched some DS9 then too but overall I wasn't a fan of Trek because I was a child and couldn't understand the storylines. I watched Voyager with him regularly as a teenager. So I watched the Abrams Star Trek movies and got nostalgic for the times I bonded with my dad watching Trek and wanted to take the voyage myself. Found I loved Trek. Watched TOS, then TNG, then DS9. 

It took me a year or so to get through DS9. I liked almost every episode (only ep I truly hate was the one where they're stuck inside the game on season 1), I liked every character. I can't believe how much its series finale is impacting me. Yesterday I hummed the shows theme song at work all day. Just thinking about the ending makes me cry. I can't believe it's over. I can't believe the characters are gone and I'll never be caught up in their lives anymore.

I have a few problems with the finale. Namely, I feel that Damar deserved to live. He should have lived and gave a broadcast to both Cardassia and Bajor to finally build a bridge between their two worlds. To officially seal the end of the old Cardassia (literally) and the birth of a new one. But they killed him and no speech was had. Just Cardassia and its ashes. It's utterly depressing and it amazes me how given how much the show harped on the relationship between the two planets, they neglected to take advantage of showing a bridge between the two nations, in earnest, at last. It's a baffling creative decision and leaves me wanting. Instead, they decided to make a scene at Vic's. 

Besides that, and the fact that Ezri and Julian feels tacked on and forced, I thought the ending was about as good as it could get. 

Right now I'm mourning that I'll never see the characters I love again. Kira, with her strong headed badassery, and her soft spirituality. She may very well be my favorite Star Trek character but I'm still deciding. The woman who was able to let go of her hate for Caradassians and work to help free them. The ending shot of her and Jake looking longingly for Sisko's return broke my heart, but what made me most emotional was Worf. Worf was always my favorite Star Trek character even as far back as when I was a kid. Besides Kira, no other character resonates with me as much as him and he really shined in DS9. So the final shot of him leaving the station looking at the promenade made me cry so hard because I knew it'd be the last time I'd ever seen Worf in Trek and I was forced to say goodbye to someone I've known since I was a child.

I can't believe I'm mourning someone that isn't even real. 

I can't believe it's over. Someone hold me.",Yesterday I finished DS9 after watching for a year. Please mourn with me.,1

"Not sure if this is the right forum to discuss this, but is anyone else underwhelmed or even disappointed with the quality of Eaglemoss’s offerings? 

My first purchase was Defiant, and while it wasn’t as accurate as I could hope it was decent for a $22 toy. I picked up a Steamrunner that was okay, but the nacelles have embedded blue plastic rather than the fully enclosed nacelles I saw in First Contact. 

I gave it one last shot with the Sovereign, especially since so many people online have raved about it. What a letdown. It appears to be the First Contact variant with its extremely light colored finish, but the detailing is absolute rubbish, and some details that should be visible just aren’t there. 

I looked at the XL line but reviews and pictures made me change my mind. The XL Defiant has inaccurate nacelles, the XL Sovereign either has misaligned painted details or just blank hull, and the XL Galaxy looks rubbish to me. 

I think Eaglemoss’s level of detail is okay for very small ships like Defiant and probably the shuttles, but they lack the definition to replicate the bigger ships with any clarity. Out of three purchases, I’m 70% satisfied with one and dissatisfied with the others.

"They eject the core, the Caatati steal it, they ambush Voyager and say that they have their warp core, Seven makes the device to replicate Thorium, they say 'thanks,' and then they leave.

"I've been thinking about running a Star Trek RPG soon, and about the Treaty of Algeron (forbidding the Federation from developing cloak technology), and about the premise of a continuous narrative chain through The Wrath Of Khan, The Search For Spock, The Voyage Home, and The Undiscovered Country (skipping ST5 entirely).

My best recollection is as follows: in TSFs, Kruge was aware of preliminary diplomatic talks between the Klingon and Federation governments, well before the Praxis disaster. And similarly, in TUC, the Romulan Ambassador was present at the Khitomer conference for reasons not made clear in the film itself. 

My understanding is that, since everything else in TSFS flows directly from the aftermath of the Genesis debacle, it follows that the diplomatic efforts Kruge referenced do as well. The Genesis device soon proved to be an utter failure as a terraforming system, but its applicability as a planet-killing weapon was instantly obvious to everyone involved. 

So my conclusion is that the Treaty of Algeron isnt so much that the Romulans can have cloaking technology but the Federation can't; rather that nobody can be allowed to have both the capacity to create a Genesis device and the capacity to deploy it under cloak to an enemy world. Each of the political powers on the galactic stage can have one or the other, but if anybody tries to have both, then everyone else unites to obliterate them. 

Seen in this not-necessarily-canon light, the Romulan Commander Taris in TNG: Contagion, insisting that the Federation could not be allowed to gain control of Iconian Gateway technology... starts to look a lot less villainously nationalistic.

So I saw the first two episodes. Farpoint was good, if a bit quirky and slow-paced.

But, S1E2, The Naked Now, has really put me off.

I'll forgive the one-dimensional 'everyone gets drunk and now almost everyone just wants to screw each other.' Only a handful actually do *other* drunk things. It's dumb but fine. Must be a lot of tension being stuck on a ship forever, even if it was shown in the pilot the enterprise is actually pretty big. Maybe Starfleet don't allow crew to have formal relationships?

I had also expected Wesley to be a problem, it's a bit of a meme. But this trope of 'bumbling idiot endangers the cast and gets rewarded' really gets to me.

Wesley, a child civilian, starts a mutiny, assumes command of Engineering, couldn't care less the ship was being taken apart right next to him, and finally, instead of being thrown in the brig as a timeout, he's *rewarded* for buying a few extra seconds for someone else to fix his problem?

Please tell me that this isn't a common occurrence. Or at least a list of the episodes where that trope exists, so I can avoid them like the plague.

"I will admit, although I like the show so far, I haven't had a huge urge to watch the season as a whole again and haven't yet. 

In fact I realized that a lot of the season just wasn't very repeatable and because I just wasn't very compelled to watching the Klingon War stuff but that is literally 2/3rds of the season. And because its so serialized it makes it hard to just pick out an episode and watch it on it's own. But maybe others feel differently. 

But for me, I have only watched four episodes twice thus far. They are:

-The Vulcan Hello (being first and all)

-Context is for Kings

-Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Insane (and easily my favorite for the season)

-Lethe (literally just watched this a second time a few days ago and gave me the ideas for this thread)

But that's been it so far. I been thinking to rewatch the first MU episode as it was very good IMO but haven't done it yet. What's funny is I was excited about the show being on AA because its the first Trek show you can just watch over and over again without recording it. But haven't done it.

We've decided to run a little experiment this week. As our sub has grown and grown over the last year (at the moment we're averaging around 100 new subscribers a day!), we've started to feel like it's become less like a community and more like a bunch of strangers getting together to talk about something they're interested in. Which is fine, but we'd like to bring back a bit of that family feeling and get to know each other a bit better. 

So we will be trying out having an ""off topic"" post, pinned to the top of the sub for a day or so every week, where users can gather, have a tall glass of prune juice or Romulan Ale, and talk about how things are going and what you're doing/looking forward to/cooking/playing/watching. Depending on how it goes and the schedules for the new Trek shows, it might move around the week a bit (and because Ten Forward Tuesday sounds better tbh).

"I've made several posts in the past about making my way through the Star Trek canon and recently I finished Deep Space Nine on my first run through. It is, by far, my favorite incarnation of Star Trek and I was truly sad to see it go. 

Once I finished DS9 I moved on to Voyager. Whenever I made posts previously, Voyager always seemed to get a lot less love than other versions of Star Trek. Some even cautioned me to avoid it altogether. Well, Voyager's first season is only 15 episodes so it has been going by pretty quickly. Today I finished season one and honestly I can't yet see why people disliked it. 

There are some things that immediately stand out as being a stretch...first off, the crew seemed to take the whole 70,000 light years and 75 years to get home pretty easily in the early episodes. I'd imagine if something like that happened in real life, there probably would have been a mutiny of some kind with Maquis personnel desperately trying to overthrow the Starfleet personnel aboard the ship. Further, Janeway seems to put a lot of trust in Chokotay despite having previously been in hot pursuit of him as a Maquis traitor. Making him her first officer and then immediately giving him all her trust seemed....fool hearty. I get that over time they would develop a good working relationship and she'd grow to respect and value his counsel but within the first 2 episodes everyone seems too.....chummy. 

That being said, this is more like TNG than I think I had thought it would be. They are exploring, meeting new species, getting into trouble, getting out of said trouble....it really reminds me of TNG in a lot of ways. Storylines don't seem to have the length or consequence that they did in DS9 and at least thus far I can't tell if there will be any major character arcs that will take place because there really hasn't been much previews of that thus far. 

I like Kate Mulgrew and I like Captain Janeway. Sure she's no Sisko....or Picard for that matter but so far, she's made decisions in all the ways I'd expect a Federation captain would despite their circumstances. Hopefully I'll grow to like her more as the series continues but I doubt she'll ever vie for my top spot which is currently a very close tie between Sisko and Picard (with Kirk as a close second). 

Anyway - just wanted to share my experiences so far. ",I just finished Season 1 of Voyager and I don't get the hate this show sometimes gets,1
"It seems odd, in a film so centrally about Data and about his relationship with Picard, that the whole story would just treat him as an emotionless android. In fact, there's even a line where he says something akin to, ""I don't feel"". 

That's not true!  Generations and First Contact went to great lengths to establish Data's emotions, and even if Insurrection mostly ignored it (by writing the Emotion Chip out of the story in the opening scene), it at least was aware.

I've always found this so weird about Nemesis. Especially since Spiner co-wrote.",Why did Nemesis forget about Data's Emotion Chip?,1
"A while ago I saw some YouTube videos by someone who I will refrain from naming as to not shame them. In their videos, they talk about Trek lore. And I've noticed a serious disdain for Discovery and the fans of that series. He loves to be sarcastic about the flaws of the show, the Vulcan/Klingon first contact part especially. Yet he shrugs off other inconsistencies of equal merit and tries to reconcile them rather than mock them.

So this got me thinking. How important is continuity in this franchise? After all, there are a great number of inconsistencies of varying degrees of scale. Phasers supposedly able to obliterate planets, yet I can't recall them ever using more than a sliver of that power anywhere. Even during wartime when it would be justified. Then there's Voyagers ""limited"" torpedo supply, Picard not showing any real adverse effects to assimilation unless it suits the plot, solutions to problems never being mentioned again, I could go on and on.

And yeah, you could reconcile these, but so could you with the cracks in Discovery. It's hypocritical to throw those under the bus while brushing aside the rest. Trek has ALWAYS had errors in continuity. And personally, I can accept it. Past, present and future. I may make fun of them at times, but in the end, I feel they are part of Trek. And so I learn to live with them. And reconcile when I can.

Why didn't Worf suffer and legal or career consequences for his actions in this episode. He took control of the planets weather control system. He clearly didn't have permission or authority to do it, and it's something that seems to have had a massive effect.

Not only that, but he gave control of the system to someone who seemed to be intent on destroying everything on the planet.

"As the title says, what are your thoughts for a series that doesn’t focus on Humanity and the Federation? 

Personally, I think there’s a lot of areas to explore with a series about the Vulcan Expeditionary Group or the Romulan Star Empire as opposed to continuing on with the same premises. 

The galaxy is a very different place post DS9 and Voyager with horizons only expanding to the other quadrants. 


With the Federation, there always seems to be a powerful, oppressive regime to create a ""big bad” villain with each series. This helps alleviate the episodic-ness of each episode, but it's become a bit redundant.

* ENT had the Klingons.

* DIS has the Klingons.

* TOS was largely episodic with recurring villains.

*TNG had the Borg (this is especially where the magnanimous ""big bad"" took hold in the later seasons)

*DS9 had the Cardassian/Dominion/Jem'Hadar alliance, the penultimate big bad before the Borg. 

* VOY had, of course, the Borg.


With the Romulans, there is no true friend around to quickly broker tentative alliances with; diplomacy isn’t for making friends, it’s for *Romulan* security and staving off the wolves. A lone Empire in a sea of foes - the Klingons one  side, the Federation on the other, and a vast expanse of space we’ve never encountered in *Trek* at their backs.

For Vulcans, we could see what it’s like to be on the other side of the Federation. Fans often ask why the Federation seems disproportionately human, and I’d argue that the Federation is largely a human endeavor. That’s not to say that the Vulcans are along for the ride, but it very much reminds me of NATO and SEATO wherein the United States spearheads most initiatives. Such a premise opens the door for different perspectives and problem solving that doesn’t involve pointing the business end of humanity at the enemy — joint operations where cultures may clash a reluctance on the part of Vulcans to receive human help, even if it’s to their detriment.",What are your thoughts on a non-Federation centered series?,1

"Human explorers aboard Starships should be ""passengers"" who only labor because they want to, not because they are needed to. 
In effect, starships should be ""The Magic School Bus"" -- a fantastical vehicle that does not need human crews, but rather which takes humans where they want to go and which facilitates them educating themselves about the mysteries of the universe. 

Star Trek features peak humans, morally developed, disciplined, expert, and cooperative. And yet Star Trek has always betrayed anxiety about the usefulness and utility of even top-of-the-line homo sapiens. 

Mr. Spock, nearly-machine in his perfect logic, reflected the fundamental limitation of even peak humans. No one could hope to keep up with his encyclopedic knowledge and ability to make computations on the fly to several decimal places. Instead, the writers offered compensatory virtues in humans, such as emotional intelligence and intuition. This is only sharpened in the character of Data who actually is a machine, the one character on TNG who could have done the job of anyone else in the crew and frankly could have done it better if not just as well.  

TOS confronts the problem the usefulness of even apex-humans in ""The Ultimate Computer"" and the situation only resolves itself when the machine turns out to be psychotic, but this only delays the question. If the M5 was not ready for prime time, then certainly M6 or M9 would have been. 

By TNG the problem is a bit more acute with the ship's computer occasionally becoming sentient and sentient creatures being accidentally generated in Holodeck programs. Quite frankly, humans should not be needed to run the ship given the tremendous intelligence built into the ship's systems. 

Think of the economics of Trek. In the future there is (and is not) money. Trek can't make up its mind, however, what is clear is that people don't really need to work and that humanity is at a point where everyone can basically follow their passions as far as their merit will take them. No one goes hungry. There is no want, outside of career ambitions for limited posts in institutions like Star Fleet. In short, labor is not needed--people do what they want to do. 

Having a captain of the ship telling the Magic School Bus where to go next perhaps makes sense, but do helmsmen? Does it make sense to have engineering staff? Most ""jobs"" aboard the Enterprise are really superfluous. The idea of humans constantly laboring to keep the ship working is a downright ""steampunk"" idea given not only advancements in real-world information technology, but especially in light of the fictional assertions of show itself.

"The visual changes to Klingons over the years have been addressed in DS9 and Enterprise. The Augment Virus, which spread throughout the Empire, would likely have resulted in a negative social stigma towards infected Klingons. We know that during TOS, Klingons were still being affected by the virus (hence their human-like appearance), the Kelvin-Timeline films would've had to address this as well. 


In Star Trek: Into Darkness (as well as some deleted scenes from Star Trek 2009), [we see several Klingons wearing helmets that mimic head ridges](http://www.startrek.com/uploads/assets/articles/4761908541417785dacbf457963dd2b89c511612.jpg). These [helmets](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/30/57/e930573e12fd0e678c7812efa9920644.jpg) could have been used as a means to allow a Klingon warrior to avoid the negative stigma of looking human as a result of the Augment Virus' infection. 


The Kelvin-Timeline costume-designers used these helmets as a clever way of avoiding the continuity issues with the era, while still making it obvious that these warriors were Klingon. With the Augment Virus being established canon, the reason for these helmets during this point in Klingon history makes sense.

During the 2nd season (1967-1968) the few fans of the show feared NBC is going to cancel it.

A disappointing result? On the contrary!

By the end of the 2nd season just 55 episodes were aired - too little for [syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication). The 3rd season however brought the total to 79 episodes and that was a syndication enabling number.

Syndication expanded the fan base. Most Americans who grew up on Star Trek, grew up on the reruns, not on the original broadcast. Syndication is what allowed Star Trek to become a phenomenon with such a deep cultural, social and technological impact.

We're now watching Enterprise, it's very well done in terms of the look of the ship, the aliens, and the away missions. We're not too fond of the way the Vulcans are portrayed so far, but still sticking with it.

"It honestly blows my mind that we’re still talking about the Klingons in Discovery, and for some people it seems like the second biggest deal breaker in the show to them (the first just generally being that it’s another prequel). 

Star Trek has been around for more than 50 years, and in that time we’ve seen multiple species change their appearances and at no time has the fandom in general had as big a problem with it as the current Klingon design. 

Of course, it all started in 1966, and the original Klingons were little more than goatee wearing [villains of the week ](https://i.imgur.com/wazbM1e.jpg), nothing special, not much to them really. Some classic episodes of course, and some memorable characters. The low budget forced this design choice of course. And this was the way of things until the motion picture changed everything. 

V’ger’s first on screen kill, a couple Klingon D7 cruisers that couldn’t handle the V’ger torpedos. Kirk &amp; company watch as these [totally new Klingons ](https://i.imgur.com/92Fatym.jpg) got waxed in the first ten minutes of the movie. Here we see the first bits of Klingon language, the armor, and at first glance these look like tng Klingons, but there’s some differences. The forehead ridges extend all the way through the nose, there’s no break at the ridge like Worf, the hair is kind of a mess for the usually well kept Klingons. They’re close to what everybody knows and loves but not quite there. 

Then we have the modern Klingons that everyone knows and loves. It all started with [Commander Kruge](https://i.imgur.com/quOU5OJ.jpg) the first of the quintessential Klingon. Marveling at the destruction of the Genesis planet and calling it beautiful. When pretty much any other actor (not named [Michael Dorn](https://i.imgur.com/YiEdI6V.jpg)) puts on the prosthetics, and plays a Klingon, they start channeling what Christopher Lloyd does in Star Trek 3. 

Now, I’ll acknowledge that Star Trek 3 to Nemesis/end of Enterprise is a long time, 20 years actually. So 20 out of 50 years of produced Star Trek this is what Klingons looked like. It feels a lot longer thanks to constant reruns and being able to watch on demand. 

Then came 2009, and the rebooted universe. And with it came New Klingons, most prominent in the relatively poor movie [Into Darkness](https://i.imgur.com/xL0PDvi.png). They’re close to the next gen Klingons, but decidedly different. 

Now, here we are at Discovery, and the so called [monstrosity](https://i.imgur.com/SdCrKZT.jpg) that is the new Klingon. So that’s 5 different version. Some subtle, some not so subtle. 

The show says they’re Klingons, therefore they’re Klingons. As long as the narrative is good, and the actors give it their best, what does it matter? 

Was the first season of Discovery the best Trek ever? No. But in my opinion it was the best first season of any Star Trek series to date. I’m excited to keep watching, I hope it gets better. 

But more than anything I’m thankful for Discovery, cbs all access, and all of you who like me cancelled it immediately after the season ended. Because of all of that, we have more new Star Trek and Sir Patrick Stewart is apart of it. 

So there’s my argument. 5 different Klingon versions in 50 years. It’s just another change. No big deal. 

Much like [this change](https://i.imgur.com/eQ5rrxo.jpg) to [this](https://i.imgur.com/7V93bDO.jpg) doesn’t bother me. ","Why I don’t care what the Klingons look like, and why you probably shouldn’t either",1

"Every iteration that we see from TOS to DSC are just different selective breeds of Klingons.

The Klingons are very clannish and xenophobic, even with themselves.  The Klingon houses are very segerated and a very strict caste system is enforced which then reinforces the selective breeding process creating very different looks over the countless generations.  

For a real world example, look at dogs.

Dogs are highly unusual in their variation, from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane. (Recently, body size was found to be largely explained by differences in a single gene among dog breeds.) Darwin realized that man can force selection by picking particular individuals for breeding who show a particular characteristic that we want to see in our pets. So humans can accelerate the process of selection dramatically by exploiting the diversity naturally found in domestic forms and homing in on a form that is desirable. Natural selection usually acts more slowly, relying on what Darwin described as ""descent with modification""--the chance arrival of new forms through DNA mutation.

The Klingons did this to themselves.  Warriors bred with warriors, scientists with scientists, philosophers with philosophers, etc.",Very simple reason why Klingons always look different,1

"Since we probably wont hear anything real about the new show for awhile I would love to see people pull out their creativity and think about what kind of show they would like to see.  With me I would love to see Trek continue to take the issues of today and tell some wonderful stories.   No judgement on anything you post.  

For me the show would open up Earth coming out of an almost 2 decade long period of isolation .  a terrorist attack on Earth by the Typhon Pact caused the death of millions, including the Federation President.  Earth pushed for all out war with the Pact but the Federation council denied such action and instead insisted on opening dialogue and engaging sanctions.  As a result Earth removed itself from the Federation.  20 years later Earth is under new leadership and there is a desire to rejoin the Federation community.  

The Federation welcomes them back but with conditions.  Most of the Starfleet ships are almost entirely crewed by non humans and the younger Starfleeters have not ever met a human.  They need to take things slow.  

Earth is given a Starship the USS Destiny.  (much like how in the past we saw Starships with only Vulcan crews).  A crew is assembled from Earth to man the new Starship.  The Federation has decided that they would like to add a few new job positions on board the new ship.  Ambassador Jean Luc Picard who left Earth with his wife and son is asked to join as the First Contact Specialist.   Picard's son is a teenager and doing his own thing.  Picard is looking for new challenges.  The new Discovery Captain has a certain amount of respect for him, but also doesn't want Picard stepping on his toes.  A new species that Earth has no experience with has joined in a ""social media capacity""  Her job is to broadcast a daily ""blog"" out to the Federation so that people can be energized by Earth's reentry. No one likes her position on the ship and find her to be too obtrusive, but understand they have a lot to prove to a galaxy that has done well without Earth over the past 2 decades.    Jamie Kirk is  the new helm the ship.  Earth felt that they wanted a name that had always been respected throughout Starfleet and history. She will have  a lot on her shoulders proving herself to her Captain and a universe that knows the name Kirk carries a lot of expectations.  

Destiny's first mission is Bajor.  The wormhole has been emitting some odd signals and the whole area seems to be cut off from communication.  Destiny arrives to find the Wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant becoming unstable.  There also seems to be some sort of time/space effect around the region.  Bajor goes from being a member of the Federation to in the blink of an eye a burned out husk of a planet.  Then moments later a Cardassian strong hold and then the whole planet disappears and only rubble remains.  Sciences determines that the time stream is in flux and its due to the wormhole, something inside is affecting time in this region of space.  

A crew is sent inside the wormhole were they find a small white ""egg"" emitting high levels of energy.   Inside they find a being.  They disconnect him from the egg and get him back to their ship.  Once outside the time shifts seem to stop and Bajor is back to normal.  The being is simply know as Morgan. The odd thing is that this person looks different to each crew member who interacts with him/it.  To Picard The Morgan looks just like his teenage son.  To the Captain the Morgan looks like an Androrian.  To the Social Media person the Morgan looks like her 80 year old grandmother.  The Morgan explains that he/it has no idea who they are.  He remembers driving down a road on Earth in his old Chevy.  Then a bright light.  Then he remembers an Earth where Humans ruled the galaxy through fear (mirror universe) he remembers a universe where Vulcan was destroyed.  He appears to exist outside of our normal time and space.  He knows he is here with Destiny for a reason because something ""big"" is coming.  But has no idea what.  He doesn't know if he will be able to help, just observe or actually be a liability.     He also cannot be removed from the ship.  The Captain of the Destiny decides to send him to Bajor and let Federation Doctors and Scientists figure out what is going on.  But moments after beaming him down, he is once more standing on the bridge with no idea why it didn't work.  It is decided that for better or worse Morgans Destiny lies with this ship and crew.

"There seem to be two camps of Star Trek fans:

1. There is the camp who wants to live in the period they were introduced in when they started watching the show, TOS, TNG, etc and wants a continuation or constant connections to those eras and characters. They love Star Trek but they want to stay with one particular show mostly.

2. And then there is the camp who just loves the concept of what Star Trek represents in itself and wants to see that concept expanded as much as possible always innovating itself with new ideas, time periods and characters. 

I believe the great majority of Trek fans are probably in the first camp but I could be wrong. But I look at the excitement with announcements of characters like Picard and Spock returning. Some people may have issues with them but the reception does seem overwhelmingly positive. Probably more so with Stewart since we haven't seen Picard for so long. 

But I know there are definitely people like me who wants to see Star Trek go different directions, different eras, settings, etc. DS9 is my favorite show for that reason. It took chances on a premise, story and production level no other Trek show has tried since. It was considered the black sheep of the family for a long time but now many have come to love it because it breaks out of the norms the other shows did. 

In many ways I was looking forward to Discovery because at least they went the direction of a new crew on a new ship and there were some changes to the old format like not having the Captain the main lead and rebooting a lot of the visuals. But I also feel being a prequel to TOS kind of weighed it down and while I look forward to season 2 more than 1 I can't help but feel it's going a bit backward by making Spock and Pike big additions next season. It almost feel like a TOS inspired season instead of focusing on its own characters. But that's just me. 

And if you are in Camp one then I imagine it's exactly the thing you want and CBS of course hoping you want it or why do it?

I've been a lover hard sci-fi/spec-fi for many years. I've known of  star trek but haven't come around to watching it until recently. I started with TNG.  it would be hard to describe the degree to which I've loved it. However, I just watched the first episode of the fifth season and it seemed like a betrayal of all I've completely loved about this show. I felt like turning it off mid episode and never watching the show again. Honestly I was scared to see something I came to appreciate and love so deeply disintegrate in around 10-15 minutes. I stopped watching.

I just want to know if my heart will be broken further with TNG. I plan to watch the others going forward but can you blame me for being attached to Picard and the feel of the Enterprise under his steady hand? What I saw was disgusting and it kind of.brings me to the larger point. Was it coopted by the network?

"So I’ve never watched any of the actual Star Trek TV series or movies, besides the JJ Abrams/Bad Robot films. With the hype around Sir Patrick Stewart’s return to the franchise, the hype and popularity of Discovery, and my constant hearing about Star Trek news and praise from Tested.com, Adam Savage, and Norman Chan specifically I decided to give it a try. I’ve existed within nerd culture for a while so I’m already familiar with many of the references, characters, ships, plot points, races, scenes, props, technology, themes, memes, and moments. I always liked the concept, but never decided to jump fully into it. I was surprised to see almost everything available on Amazon Prime Video. I started watching TOS remastered, with the pilot episode featuring Captain Pike and the gloriously campy cardboard graphics, and the first two episodes after that. I’m loving the experience so far, but I couldn’t help but notice how much better it looks so far than I expected it to. 

I mean, the pilot showed the Enterprise as a flat image superimposed on a spacey background, and then the next episode it’s a CG three dimensional object. It was a bit jarring, but as I’m more accustomed to modernized visuals in television it was more welcomed. I did watch all of the modern Doctor Who series a few years back and enjoyed that, so slightly campy sci-fi fun and diplomacy is right up my alley. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed what I’ve seen so far, and was shockingly surprised by how personal, deep, and adult the show is right off the bat. I guess I never thought of Star Trek as a kids show, but somehow I never expected it to deal with sexual themes and adult issues so quickly. I’m also super impressed by how progressive the show is, especially for its time. 

My question is though, will I be shunned by mega-fans because I’m watching the Remastered TOS? I have many friends who are hardcore fans of all thinks Trek, and I don’t want to talk to them, or meet other fans at conventions, and immediately have my thoughts and opinions disqualified by elitism or toxic fan-boy culture. I’m okay with watching it either way, and I know that most fans are more into with TNG than TOS, but I’d just like to be educated on the matter rather than ignorant. I’m not saying I expect negativity out of the community, but I’ve existed in nerd culture for a while, and I know how toxic things can get (insert The Last Jedi Opinion here).

"Seems to be a lot of people finishing their first watch of this Trek show in particular lately.

Since starting the franchise in January I've now seen TOS, the TOS movies, TNG, the TNG movies and now DS9. I've also watched the NuTrek movies and Discovery. This is the most material I've ever watched of one single franchise.

I have to say that out of all of it so far DS9 is my favorite. I love how you get to see the characters grow and evolve. You really get invested in their journeys. The fact that it really leans into having actual story arcs is just fantastic.

I don't think it was perfect, like everything it had it's flaws. I really didn't care very much for Bajoran politics and religion. Kira always annoyed me. In the beginning she's always shouting and whining, scrunching up her face and shaking her head around. Then she doubles down on her faith as well. Never really bought her relationship with Odo either. The ""will they won't they"" thing between them was a bit taxing.

Other than that it was little things, a bit too many Ferengi episodes, a little too much Vic Fontaine towards the end. The mirror universe stuff wasn't all that interesting. I like fun one off episodes just fine but I got so into the whole dominion war that you just wanted the one offs to be over so they could continue the main story.

Julian was kind of a creep that wouldn't take no for an answer when it came to women. Didn't really buy Siddigs performances whenever he had to raise his voice and try to be serious and commanding.

It's only a Paper Moon has to the single finest bit of Trek I've ever seen so far. This episode really floored me. I haven't been in a war or lost a limb but when Nog starts talking about how he's afraid to go out in to the real world and live a real life, and he's afraid of the fact that he doesn't know what will happen out there and that he can't control it. He'd rather stay in a fake world knowing that it probably isn't good for him in the long run but at least he knows what the future is going to be like. I really identified with that.",I've also finished watching DS9 for the first time [Spoilers],1
"I find the fact that we're going to have multiple Star Trek IP's competing against each other to be beyond fascinating. I was too young to enjoy the TNG/DS9/VOY competition, in that I only got into VOY when it was on-air, rather than TNG or DS9.

At any rate, Patrick Stewart's Star Trek is going to go directly against Discovery, in that both will likely rotate airings within the same year. This means that after 20 years, we're actually going to get two Treks at once, which hasn't happened since DS9 ended in 1999.

We can see from this handy [website/graph](http://www.madmind.de/2009/05/02/all-star-trek-movies-and-episodes-in-two-charts/) that TNG enjoyed a huge advantage over DS9 of about 30-40% over most episodes outside of Emissary during TNG Seasons 6/7. DS9/Voyager's competition was much closer, at about 10-15% on average, although both consistently saw declining numbers each season, which is sad. Its humorous that all the Netflix data that's at hand (what there is of it) suggests that Voyager is actually more-watched than DS9, and possibly as much as TNG or even slightly moreso.

At any rate, what are your thoughts? Will Stewart-Trek get a CBS OTA episode like Discovery? If it did, I could see that one blowing Discovery out of the water, as Discovery abjectly lacks a big name star, whereas Stewart's fame seems to continue to grow into his 80s.

Myself, assuming that the series is pretty good, will be mired in the difficulty of obtaining exactly how many people subscribe to CBSAA because of Stewart-Trek. However, twitter, IMDB and other social media sites should be able to provide some sort of quantifiable metric. I think that we could see a DS9-TNG style difference, where Discovery is about 30-40% lower than Stewart-Trek.

I only bring this part up because the Section 31 series of novels have gone in a completely awful, **awful** direction that completely undermines the optimistic spirit of the Federation and the entire *Star Trek* franchise in a way that's even more pervasive than the existence of Section 31 in the first place.

I've finally gotten around to watching star trek continues.  I never really liked the original series but I guess I was kind of feeling nastalgic.  This will contain spoilers so don't read any further if you haven't seen it.  Anyway in the second episode the enterprise rescues an orion slave girl from a telerite ship.  Kirk is then ordered by starfleet to turn her over to the orion who sold her to the telerites.  He does everything he can to avoid it but he eventually hands her over.  He changes his mind and decides to go after her.  But she had caused a warp core breach in the orian's ship so it was too late.  What pissed me off is that the federation is perfectly willing to condemn someone to a life of slavery just avoid a conflict.  If you ask me peace at that price is too damn high.  Had I been in kirk's shoes I would have refused those orders then I would have given her a shuttle and looked the other way.  It would have been worth a court martial if that's what it had come to.  Kirk following those kinds of orders makes him just as guilty as the orians.  So the federation is perfectly willing to turn a blind eye to other people's suffering as long as it doesn't effect them.  How convenient that must be for them.  They let the cardassians ravage bajor for fifty years and didn't lift a finger to stop it.  Even when they were already at war with the cardassians.  They didn't have anything to lose by liberating bajor during the border wars.  I guess it just wasn't convenient for them though.  And of course the federation's desire for peace at almost any cost is what created the maquis.  And then the federation declares them criminals when they're actions are what created them in the first place.  And regarding the prime directive there have been times when starfleet captains have stood buy and let entire civilizations get wiped out because the prime directive prevents them from interfering.  It is unconscionable to follow a rule written on a piece of paper that says you have to do nothing when you have the ability to help people.  They're are rules and regulations and then there is right and wrong.  As far as I'm concerned right and wrong is what matters most.  So if the federation is going to turn a blind eye to the injustices outside it's borders then it serves no purpose.  It's member worlds live in a utopia while the rest of the galaxy lives in misery.  The federation is willing to turn a blind eye to anything that non member worlds do as long as they're interests are not at stake.

"The idea is to mix a little of the old by adding in characters from the three 90s era shows, potentially set up a new Next Generation with the cadets, have a season-long arc, be just Starfleet enough, but the crew is basically on its own for an almost Indiana Jones-meets-Firefly-meets-Trek vibe.

The episode opens with Laforge visiting Picard who is working in the family vineyard, very similar to ""All Good Things"". Picard is retired from Starfleet and spends most of his time on archeological digs across the quadrant. He comes back home to check in on the estate, which is ran by his sister-in-law. Laforge knew Picard was back on Earth and decides to visit, which he does periodically. 

This time the visit is interrupted by one Admiral Janeway, who we see in a shot similar to her first shot in Voyager (where she visits Tom Paris at the penal colony). She wants to pull Picard out of retirement for one special mission that requires his style of diplomacy, some contacts he has made over the decades, and his archaeological knowledge. 

Picard initially refuses. He's done with Starfleet. However, Janeway appeals to his sense of duty and archeological side of the mission. Also, he will be given a ship and a small crew and will only report directly to her. He will have free range to direct the mission has he sees fit. She wasn't aware that Laforge was going to be there, but she sees this as her lucky day if she can also appeal to Geordi to join up as well. 

Janeway gives him the name of another person she has tried to get on the mission, but refused her. She hopes if Picard agrees to the job, he can convince her to join. This person is Annika Hansen, formerly known as Seven of Nine. She and Janeway have had a falling out over the years, but once she meets Picard, another victim of Bord assimilation, and hears him out, she joins up. 

They meet up with executive officer of their ship's crew: Commander Ezri Dax. She has moved into field trainer for cadets - her counseling background plus her Dominion War experience at such a young age gives her some perspective in guiding the next generation of Starfleet. Plus, she also has nine lifetimes of knowledge to fall back on. She flies the four of them to Picard's new command: a retro-fitted U.S.S. Stargazer (giving us the name of the show - Star Trek: Stargazer). 

Once arrived Picard is reinstated to the rank of Captain, Laforge the rank of Commander and chief engineer, and Hansen is given a field commission of Lt. Commander and head science officer. Dax is the XO and the small crew is made up entirely of cadets. One of the cadets is offspring of 90s era Trek crew (Kirayoshi O'Brien or Miral Paris or Natasha Riker-Troi, take your pick).

During the first mission, Picard uncovers some ancient mystery that could have broader implications for the entire galaxy. Some other players get involved and at some point during the premiere the Stargazer is attacked and the computer core is crippled. In an act of desperation Geordi uploads an AI program to stabilize the ship. This is Data's memory core. Data effectively becomes the Stargazer's computer system and appears to his old friends as a hologram. First he looks like Data from Nemesis (CGI de-aging of course), but comments on how old Geordi and Jean-Luc appear and chooses to age up his on visual matrix. This is not only to make his friends comfortable, but also a way to adjust to his new state of being. 

At the end of the first episode, Picard and his new command crew discuss the fact that the mission just got bigger than they originally were informed. Picard has it out with Janeway via sub-space communication (I personally like the holo version so we can have the two actors in the same room). He feels lied to, but he can't help that the situation has pulled at his sense of exploration and discovery. 

After the conversation with Janeway ends Picard is alone in his ready room when he hears a voice off to the side giving a snide remark about ""Katie"". Picard turns and there is Q.

Picard: *startled expression* What....who are you?

Q: Come now Picard, is that any way to treat an old friend?

"As the title states this is my random pitch for a TNG movie, initially thought up in the shower and further expanded elsewhere. This is all from quick, random thinking, and maybe has inaccuracies, but....hope you enjoy!

Setting: 2385

Jean-Luc Picard continues on as captain of the Enterprise-F, the newest flagship in the Federation. Relations with the Romulans have been gradually improving since Picard's triumph over Shinzon, and a possible alliance is in the works. The Ferengi as well have fallen on rough times and are requesting entry into the Federation (something not necessarily popular with some Federation members). The main TNG crew remain on the Enterprise (Worf is back at tactical), with Riker off captaining the USS Titan. Data is still dead, and B4 is at Starfleet Academy undergoing continued training/rehabilitation.

General Plot:

The Enterprise-F is en route to Ferengi space to join an envoy to begin negotiations on their entry into the Federation. Picard is in his ready room staring into space with narrative explaining his realization his days as captain may be limited and his thoughts of returning to the family vineyard. Following this he hears a familiar ""phase in sound,"" and a look of annoyance comes over him as he turns to expect to come face to face with a previous hindering deity...only to be face to face with a aged humanoid figure he's never seen. The being goes on some diatribe about his distaste for the chaos in the universe caused by the multitude of species, and states following his peoples' ""trials"" the decision has been made for a ""final trial."" With that he snaps his fingers and Picard is suddenly on the bridge with his crew looking out the view port at an unknown multicolored nebula.

From here it will be revealed the Enterprise is no longer in the alpha quadrant and is in unknown space. Not before long a ship approaches the Enterprise, unnervingly revealed to be a Jem'Hadar battleship. Despite attempted negotiations an epic battle ensues finding the Enterprise victorious with minimal damage/casualties. However, Worf soon reports scanners are picking up various capital ships in the surrounding areas matching the following species:

Borg

Cardassian

Andorian

Vulcan

Nausicaan

Breen

Tellarite

Klingon

Ferengi

Xindi

Gorn

Hirogen

The Enterprise also picks up odd readings of other spacial phenomena (ex: nebulas, comets, etc) and even a few unknown planets nearby. 

As the Enterprise attempts to make contact with their allies Picard is paid a visit from Q (John Delancie). Q explains the visitor he initially had is a superior Q who has deemed the universe over-inhabited (based on the ""trials"" carried out by the various Q). He explains they have been transported to the ""Q Sector"" (puns...they're fun), a space specifically designed for this final trial. The Enterprise, along with capitol ships from other species, are there as a ""battle royale"" with the winner earning claim as the dominant mortal species in the universe, at which point the Q will eliminate all other species in the universe. Q, for a second time, is ""powerless"" in the sector and can only observe and not interfere, leaving the mortals to their own devices.

What ensues would involve the following:

1) Humans and their various Federation allies doing battle with other species

2) The Borg assimilate one or more of the other species, causing the remaining species to team up against them (cause F them right?)

3) The Romulans are revealed to be there (Tomalak perhaps?)

4) Species 8472 is also revealed to be there

5) An away team being sent to one of the new planets 

.... some other stuff too (as I think more on it)

Ending: (WIP, and open to changes of course)

Ultimately it'll come down to the Enterprise and the ?Romulans. Picard powers everything down and refuses to fight anymore. It's revealed the superior Q has been interfering in the trial. The Romulans power down too and refuse to partake. The superior Q deems mortal life no longer has a place in the universe, but before he can blink it out Q does something to defeat the superior Q, sacrificing himself in the process to save....mortals. The Enterprise is blinked back en route to Ferengi space with knowledge of what happened, but undamaged. At their destination they are joined by the USS Titan to begin negotiations (and Riker gets his screen time ha).

"Every Star Trek movie is just a scenario which the Enterprise crews ""hammed up"" for cadets, acting out a role that is then learned by a computer intelligence which dynamically acts out as close a version to the original performance.  For the TNG era, these were in the Holodeck.

Generations was a Kirk program that was never completed (Enterprise-B schedule of training tapes, which never developed into a series).  Thus, Starfleet reused the ""footage"" in the first Enterprise-D schedule training tape.

The Constitution refit, the Enterprise-B variant of Excelsior, and the Enterprise-E never existed.

Only TOS, TNG, and DS9 pre-first Defiant destruction (they didn't survive) are truth.  There were refit Connies, but they were refit in the assembly line (i.e.: the assembly line was upgraded, and refit Connies were built new).  ""Refitting"" the original Enterprise was just a cheesy way to bring it into the new era (cadets were training on new equipment and an older model wouldn't have made sense, but the training tape producers wanted the ""feel"" of the Enterprise ""legacy"")

The real Enterprise-B is the one we see on the wall in the conference room on the Enterprise-D, with no flanges.  

The Dominion War ending is unknown to us, presumably a bloody slog to a stalemate.  The holosuite data from the transporter accident was used to create the post-Defiant 1 training tapes.  Ezri Dax was not trill, and never on DS9.  She was a Public Affairs media officer who worked with Starfleet Training.  She's only acting out Dax because the symbiont complicated a reproduction of Jadzia from the holosuite.  

Thus, even though the DS9 crew was killed on the Defiant, everything post-Jadzia is just an imaginary history of the crew.

Enterprise-C is the one we see on the wall in the conference room.  The Yesterday's Enterprise C came from the past of the ""War Federation"" timeline, not the main reality.  But this Enterprise did return to the past of the main timeline, explaining Tasha Yar's daughter.  Thus the real Ent-C (conference room model) was destroyed at Narendra III by the anomaly, but the alternate Ent-C (the one on screen) returns to the prime timeline's Narendra III.  Guinan's intuition wasn't caused by reality being wrong.  It was caused by prime Guinan's consciousness co-habitating with war timeline Guinan's mind until the prime timeline was secured via the return of the war Ent-C to prime.  It all has something to do with Q, and something about war Picard being a dick to Q and so Q wanted to ""trade"" war timeline's future for the prime Picard's.

Q, in fact, subtly alters reality every time he interacts with Picard.  What we don't see is Q interacting with other, alternate Picards, since surely Q would know what his others are doing.  So there's a shuffling going on, and prime Picard is prime Picard for being the best.

In the end, the movies have some inexplicable and unlikely scenarios, and out-of-character moments for the crew members.  This is because they are imaginary history training scenarios.  The use of famous crew members is a consequence wanting to give the simulations more weight for experienced cadets, a sort of fun yet challenging reward for passing basic tests.

Do they believe their ideal fan is someone who holds GoT-esque watching parties or someone who rewatches episodes to find current social parallels? Do they believe their fans come back for the Shonda Rhimes-style drama or the Black Mirror-style scifi &amp; ethics? 

Similarly, it would be interesting to know how committed CBS is to Discovery being popular? Surely Discovery is critical to their plans for CBS All Access but does that add additional pressure to the showrunners? How will the that pressure change the show? Should we expect Discovery to target fans of the JJ Abrahms films, nostalgic TOS fans, TNG+spinoff fans, or are they focused on attracting new viewers?

All of these questions would give us a better idea of what CBS wants Discovery to be and where they're trying to take the franchise.

Thanks to Plex and Tautulli I was able to go back and look and see when this journey began for me. May 12th is when I started this series after having finished TNG the previous day on May 11th. 

I'm not going to lie it was a bit of a struggle in the early seasons (namely the first two seasons) to stick with it. I felt the show lacked focus and didn't seem to have a goal in mind for what it wanted to be. Oh boy how wrong I was.

If you were to ask me now, I am not sure I'd be able to answer with certainty who stands as my favorite now.

"Don't get me wrong, ""Balance of Terror"" is an awesome episode and very much the cornerstone of what became of Romulans during the franchise's history.

When Scotty states that the romulan vessel only has ""simple impulse"" that not only flies in the face of its own design (it features two nacelles, even in viewing range of each other), but also what we see a century early in Enterprise where Romulan drone ships clearly are warp-capable. Also when Spock remarks that ""Invisibility is theoretically possible"" it is at least somewhat implied that it has not been notably achieved until then. Not only are there several species in Enterprise, including Romulans, using cloaking technologies, its deployment now is a major plot point in Discovery's first season. Next there is the general observation that neither has anyone in the Federation ever seen a Romulan (and realized it) ""nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication"" back in the good ol' days of the Romulan War from 2156-60. But there was, at least on side of the Federation predecessors and I don't see why the Romulans should not have had it either. It's a widely used technology during the time as seen in Enterprise. Furthermore it seems highly unlikely that there never was any romulan corpse floatig through space or lying on some ground battlefield and if there was that nobody cared to check what it looked like. And what did the Romulans gain by masking there appearances? If they had revealed themselves it would have spread mistrust within and towards their most powerful and advanced adversary in said war, namely the Vulcans. Everyone in their command structure could have been a Romulan. And it would have probably been even more difficult to determine who really was as it was with the Founders centuries later as there was at least one effective blood extraction test then.

Additionally, the notion that the Romulan Star Empire isolated itself for 106 years (and later again for 53 years) massively hinders all possibly development they could be subjected to. When new stories are in inception more often than not writers remind themselves that they cannot use Romulans in their story as they allegedly were absent from so many timeframes and it would ""break"" canon if they appeared. The second isolationist period in Romulan history from 2311-64 is already softened up a lot by having them fight with the Klingons at numerous times and Starfleet at least one time, Starfleet officer Stefan DeSeve defecting to the Star Empire 2349 because the ""strict moral compass"" they had projected outwards appealed to him and also they, probably the Tal Shiar though, acquire some genetic material of Jean-Luc Picard during those years - and why should they have chosen him especially if they did isolate themselves completely thus limiting the information they would have had about what happened within the Federation to know that he was an important enough figure to replace. So practically this second period is already at least reduced to 2311-40s and in my opinion the years from \~2344 until 2364 should be treated as a time of limited contact and gradual reemergence on side of the Star Empire.

Going back to the first isolationist period in Romulan history between 2160-2266, I propose that it either should be drastically shortened to open up more space for stories to develop Romulans in or also feature a time of limited contact and gradual reemergence beginning in the late 22nd or early 23rd century. As I understand Romulans it is very much in their character to disconnect from others occasionally, especially after suffering defeat or humiliation. But to keep these periods at the extend they were originally intended does nothing for them and also obstructs many storytelling possibilities or shifts those to other species thus leaving Romulans further behind until they eventually become a mere obscurity.

In conclusion, I hope that the writers of Discovery and any future incarnations of the Star Trek franchise disregard the background story established for Romulans in the TOS episode ""Balance of Terror"" even more than it has apparently been, because it would be more beneficial to them as it would be harmful. As much as has been retconned from this particular episode already it would probably be a good idea to also denounce the notion of a 106-year-long isoliationist period in Romulan history between the settings of Enterprise and TOS and in the process shorten and/or soften it up and also other statments like the unfamiliarity with the appearance of Romulans for storytelling purposes. *But what are your thoughts*?","""Balance of Terror"" while successfully establishing Romulans simultaneously hinders their further development since",1

"So I had an idea that I think would be pretty cool. I hope the show is about Picard doing archaeology on alien ruins. They could feature him discovering relics and fleshing out a story of what life was like for these ancient aliens. So the show would feature an episodic story about an ancient alien world, punctuated by Picard in the present day discovering new relics and adding pieces to the story. They could even have fun cameos from other Trek characters helping Picard in their specific field. 

It would also be interesting if they weaved it into Discovery a little bit and gave us some back story about the Kelpians and other races of that time. Perhaps even explaining the very different appearance of the Klingons from Discovery's time.

What do you guys think? I think it's the only way for a Picard based show to be excellent. I can't imagine him being an Admiral at Starfleet Command, navigating bureaucratic red tape and what not. I feel that would make a boring show, but the archaeology could go any direction, even changing from episode to episode, or perhaps following one species per season in a sweeping story arc like True Detective had done.",Picard's new show idea,1
"No, Q did not alert the Borg to the Federation's presence and abilities (as Captain Janeway once accused/implied), rather he informed the Federation of the Borg's presence and abilities.  More than that, he tricked the Borg into believing that the Federation's technology was far more advanced than it actually was.

In the final episode of STTNG's first season, the Enterprise investigates some colonies with which the Federation has lost contact.  Being close to the Neutral Zone, the crew suspects Romulan involvement.  They find the colonies have literally been wiped from the face of their planets and later find that the same has happened to Romulan outposts near the Neutral Zone.  When, in season 2, Q sends the Enterprise 7000 light years across the galaxy to force a confrontation with the Borg, the first thing the crew finds is a planet that has had all signs of machinery and technology wiped from the surface in the same manner as the Federation colonies near the Neutral Zone (as Data points out).  So the Borg already knew about the Federation, and Humans, and had a pretty good sampling of their technological (although possibly not defensive) capabilities.

The Borg might have, and certainly COULD have, at this point swarmed and completely assimilated the Federation.  However, all of a sudden, a Federation ship appears 7000 light years away from anywhere the Borg would expect them to be.  We know Q is responsible, but for all the Borg know the Enterprise has a propulsion system far beyond anything they themselves have.  They take an immediate interest in the Enterprise and beam into Engineering to conduct thorough scans.  The Borg cannot find an unknown-to-them propulsion system that does not exist.  They are determined to chase down and capture the Enterprise attacking only it's shields as to preserve the ship so that it's secrets can later be assimilated without damage.  Just as quickly as it appeared in their space, however, the Enterprise disappears back into Federation territory!

The sudden apparent ability to travel long distances instantaneously likely caused the Borg to re-think their plans to dominate the Federation.  Rather than full-scale invasion, the Borg would merely send individual ships to continue to probe the Federation and learn it's capabilities in more detail.  Eventually Captain Picard, and other Starfleet captains would be assimilated and the Borg would learn about Q.  They would learn that although apparently troublesome, he was clearly on the side of the Federation and easily able to defeat them.  Thus, they learned to tread very carefully when attempting to attack the Federation.  Furthermore, just 5 or 6 years later.... *BAM* another Federation ship, this time Voyager, appears instantaneously on the other side of the galaxy.  ""Holy SPACE,"" the Borg must have thought... the Federation keeps showing up where they don't appear to be able to reach.  Whether by technology they cannot assimilate, or by help from aliens more powerful than themselves, the Federation apparently had a clear advantage over them that the Borg dared not risk everything to overcome.

By sending the Enterprise into a confrontation with the Borg Q forced the Federation to prepare themselves better, and caused the Borg to second guess their preparedness to invade.  Q knew what he was doing, he was saving his favorite pet!

"A return to the prime timeline, sometime after the destruction of Romulus. The major powers of the alpha and beta quadrant are all still reeling from one tragedy or another. The near annihilation of Cardassia by the Dominion. The loss of the romulan Senate and subsequent loss of their homeworld. The pounding the federation took from the dominion and Borg. Klingon instability as rival Houses challange Martok and Ambassador Worf. The social revolution upending Ferengi culture. 

In response a more militant star fleet is emerging. It still Boldly Goes, but now carrying a bigger stick. The warship development program started in response to the Borg. Has grown after the dominion war. Star fleet security forces have brought back the MACOs.  

The main antagonists across the seasons would be the Tholians. Their territory is a vast swath  of the alpha quadrant. They've barely been touched upon in the TV series. 

A female andorian will be the captain of the show. A decorated veteran of the dominion war. Her first ship lost in the final battle over cardassia. Now in command of an aging Excellsior class ship. Wrapping up an aid mission in cardassian space, and heading to a starbase for decommissioning. When an urgent encrypted and highest security message comes in for her.

Detachable hull modules allow this battleship to bring  fighters and troop drop ships, or serve as hospital and refugee transport. FedIntell thinks section 31 means to start their own private war. To ensure federation dominance. Half of Starfleet and our main ship are tasked to finding it.

Which takes the first season. They travel through out non federation space. Meeting new civilizations and interacting with old ones in new ways. Eventually finding the stolen ship and taking her back. Though not before the old excellsior class is destroyed and half the named crew dies.

When Starfleet changed them to grey shoulders and coloured skivvies, it would have been in Voyagers S3. Obviously Voyager wouldn't have known about the change, and their uniforms were correct as of when they were thrown to the Delta Quadrant.  

However they would have known about the change during later seasons when they start being able to communicate with Earth. Even the EMH would have noticed when he was sent to the Prometheus.

&gt; According to George Takei's autobiography To the Stars, early drafts did feature the Excelsior discovering the Bird-of-Prey's weakness and using their gaseous anomaly equipment to find it. According to Takei, William Shatner asked that the scene be re-written, arguing that Captain Kirk would never need anyone to come charging to his rescue. The second edition of the Star Trek Chronology states that the study was a long-term one and that Enterprise, as well as several other Federation ships, had been outfitted with such equipment.

Shatner's demanded rewrite was a terrible idea.

Sulu served under Kirk for how many years? He learned everything he knew from Kirk and as such, coming to his rescue would *not* have diminished Kirk in any way. 

In fact, it would have been a better display of Kirk's competence than having him rig up the torpedo: Kirk may be about to retire, but he leaves a countless number of students like Sulu who can pick right up where he left off.

That's a *far* better legacy than telling your elderly friends to cobble together a gas-detector. It'd even counterpoint with him never truly knowing and then losing his only son. Your children are your legacy, but Kirk has been able to continue his legacy in his own way.

"Was thinking of the recent news of the Picard show announced (man we HAVE to find another title lol) and the huge excitement level it brought and basically around the world. I think it's to say most of us get totally crazy knowing we are getting a new Star Trek show. And a lot of times because they come without warning. But I was thinking it would be fun to make a thread of how everybody thought when they heard a new show was being developed, from TNG to the Picard show! Of course if you were around when TNG started or at least when a few others did. 

I'll start first!

**The Next Generation**: This was obviously the first spin off, the one that bought Trek it's first Golden Age if you will. I was still a kid at the time and this was without the internet so stuff would just show up lol. And I remember seeing the first trailer for it (which I think is still on YT). I was a major Trekkie even still being in elementary school (seen TOS countless times and all the movies except TVH because mother didn't want to take me lol). Anyway, when it hit me a **NEW STAR TREK SHOW** was coming, I didn't know what to do. Seeing that commercial was surreal. And I remember running to the TV guide the second I saw it (ask your grandparents kids) and looking for when it was coming on lol. I thought it would be next week. It was instead four months lol. Four months felt like an ETERNITY to a kid but yeah exciting time. Star Trek was coming back?? Excitement Level (EL): 10! 

**Deep Space Nine**: This is a weird one because I remember just casually reading the newspaper one afternoon (ask your parents kids) and the entertainment section. And there was an announcement in tiny print that something called 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' was coming.  It didn't even say what it was, it was just two to three lines. It did mention it was coming the next year but that's it. And Avery Brooks was already cast in it. (THE GUY FROM SPENCER???) I thought it was going to be a new movie. After a few days I found out what it was, I was DEFINITELY excited because it was the first time two Trek shows would air at the same time. When I found out it took place on a station I was like WTF?????? A station??? But still VERY excited! Because it was so mysterious but it sounded so COOL! EL: 8!

**Voyager**: At this point I was kind of use to the idea we would get more Star Trek shows, but I THINK I heard this announced on Entertainment Tonight or something. I can't remember but I was excited. They didn't mention what the show would be about other than it would be on a starship again and we would have a female Captain. I don't know why I was so thrilled over having a female Captain lol, but I was! So yeah, still pretty stoked even if just two years after DS9 was announced. EL: 8!

**Enterprise**: Sadly I think my interest in Star Trek was waning at this point. There wasn't really a surprise because we were told for literally years they were planning another show when Voyager ended. It was the first time I was keeping up with the rumors everywhere and what it could be. The 'Birth of the Federation' show was always a contender. Then they made it official when they cast Scott Bakula in the role along with the name. Sadly it was kind of a ho-hum for me. I liked Bakula but the prequel thing didn't grab me. I told myself I would check it out but didn't care as much. EL: 5!

**Discovery**: I saw this one on the IMDB front page. It WAS a surprise. After a dozen years of no new shows, poof, there it was. I was definitely excited to FINALLY get another show but it mentioned something about a website called ""CBS All Access"" (WTF is CBS All Access????) and it waned a bit. I don't know I had a feeling it was going to be a cheap show thrown together. I was definitely wrong on that but I was a bit more cautious than the others but wanted a show of ANY kind at this point. EL: 7!

**Picard show**: As we all know this was rumored for a few months now, but I didn't know to believe it or not. And then last Saturday I was literally out the door somewhere but I decided to check up on TrekMovie for any news about the convention. And the first thing I saw was Patrick Stewart in that white T-shirt smiling over all the money he's probably going to make and my mind was fucking blown! I don't know why but I SO excited for it. I missed Picard, I missed the 24th century and it literally took me back to that time as a kid when I heard TNG was coming (didn't run to any TV guide's this time though). I was giddy then and I'm giddy now about it. EL: 10!


Sorry I always run on a tangent lol. So you don't have to make any essays, just a line and what level you felt going into each show (1-10). I know we are probably going to get Star Trek news like we get DC, Marvel and Star Wars these days but its an exciting time. I still want to be giddy hearing about the next one. I don't want to just shrug like what kind of happened with Enterprise. They do a good job, I won't. ",List your excitement level when you heard the announcements of past Trek shows introduced!,1

"The reason ""Enterprise"" makes no sense as the title of the fifth series is that its titular ship is neither the first Enterprise nor the most notable.

We know it's not the first or most notable because it is never mentioned in any of the first four series (set after) or the movies. The first Enterprise was the NCC-1701 (no bloody A, B, C or D), which was the ship whose crew told the story of the first series. That ship and their crew were mentioned in every other series. Because THIS was the Enterprise all other Enterprises are named after.

When Scott asks the Enterprise D computer to show him his ship, the Enterprise, Majel doesn't wonder if he means the NX Akiraprise. Why would it? He's not asking for the nuclear wessel Enterprise or the Generations Royal Navy sailing ship, either.

The fifth season Enterprise is absent from the recreation room of the TMP Enterprise (which does display a US Navy frigate, an aircraft carrier, a NASA orbiter and an early interstellar starship Enterprise) and from the observation lounge on the D (which also includes an aircraft carrier).

What I'm getting at is that the TOS, TNG and movie Enterprises are NOT named in honour of the ship of the fifth series, which has had no impact on the culture of the Federation (or on our popular culture); it's obviously the other way around. (Which doesn't make sense chronologically, but who's fault is that? Stop making prequels if you can't get basic continuity right.) Calling the series ""Enterprise"" when its starship is the LEAST notable Enterprise and NOT EVEN THE FIRST Enterprise makes NO sense. It was a dumb retcon; simple as that.

"Two friends of mine, Kyle and Daniel, recently wrote some interesting thoughts on why STAR TREK isn't as relevant as it used to be.

***KYLE:*** *""By the time TNG came along, some of TOS technology already was already becoming a reality and seemed dated for a show set so far in the future. People shrugged it off because TOS was an old show, and TNG presented a more modern look at what the 'future' looked like. Now, TNG-era technology is a reality. I'm using it to type this comment right now.""*

***DANIEL:*** *""Back in 2011, I went to a convention where most of the TNG cast was there.  During the big panel, Michael Dorn (Worf) began talking about Trek technology.  Dorn mentioned how one day, not long before that panel, he was at his home reading something on his iPad, and he had a sudden realization.  He was now holding in his hand a real version of the fake pads they used to pass around on the Enterprise.  The future happened.*

*""Trek just used to be more thoughtful about things; it gave people something to aspire to (which directly or indirectly led to innovation in the real world).  I think that’s one of the big things missing.  It takes visionaries to pull that off, though; and I don’t think we’ve had many of those connected with Trek in a long time.  Creators have been following technology instead of blazing ahead of it.""*

I wonder if this is why the writers have stayed in the 24th century, reversed to the 22nd and are currently staying in the 23rd. STAR TREK's future seemed so far away and now it doesn't.

When I was a child, I didn't really find TNG very interesting with its bland characters and robotic dialogue. But the world of the Enterprise-D enraptured me: a world of holodecks, artificial intelligences, androids, replicators, tablet computers, mobile communications. I longed to live there and now we do.

You could also write stories about them threatening to supplant their creators as a species or at least humans feeling threatened by their growing presence.

Perhaps Vice-Proconsul M'ret could have the Tal Shiar member contact him in order to facilitate the connection (M'ret defected in TNG: Face of the Enemy"" so has ties to the federation and Picard personally).

\- - -

Keep in mind this is in the original Trek timeline, not the Kelvin timeline. This means that Vulcan has not been destroyed, but it does mean that Romulus was destroyed by the supernova Spock tried to stop.

This series takes place 20 years after Nemesis (Romulus was destroyed less than 10 years later).

\- - -

This is 10 years since the Romulans have needed to rebuild. It's long enough for there to be some sort of foundation to society be rebuilt, and also for that reformed society to begin to crack. Picard would need to pool his resources within the Federation to help the Romulans. He has to do it without the official support of either, however.

...This is because some Romulans blamed the federation for not coming to their aid quickly enough. This was in the first of the new films of course and their primary motivation to attack the Kelvin and destroy Vulcan. This same sentiment is likely true for other Romulans as well. Because of this, the Federation and Romulans are again at odds and relations are worse than they have been in decades.

This would provide for some very dynamic alliances and relationships developing. We would see old friends as enemies, others choosing their friendships over loyalties. And on the flipside, we would see old enemies as necessary allies.

"[Here's the article](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/new-star-trek-reboot-starring-patrick-stewart-cbs-latest-all-ncna898121)

&gt;It’s a dream come true for a generation of “Star Trek” fans who grew up on the rebooted concept as well as spin-offs “Deep Space Nine” and “Voyager.” But it also represents a retreat by CBS from the progressivism of its first series on All Access, “Star Trek: Discovery.”

The main thrust of this article is to impugn the motives of CBS for producing a new Trek show starring a white male lead. It begins to do this by critiquing the racial and gender makeup of the cast and crew of TNG.

&gt;The show championed liberal values, but its the cast was more than 75 percent white and male, and the production team behind it was 100 percent both.

It draws a clear distinction between liberal values and the racial and gender makeup in terms of value, and places emphasis on the latter.

&gt;As a bonus, Stewart himself is openly liberal, championing women in the #MeToo era, discussing the lasting effects of domestic violence on society and campaigning for equality for all. He is that rare A-list celebrity who remains unsullied by scandal or hypocrisy.

In fact, the article goes out of its way to compliment Patrick Stewart for his liberal values while still calling his casting into question.

&gt;More likely, CBS is using the nostalgic reboot to placate the (white, male) demographic that felt alienated by the network’s first Trekkie reboot “Discovery,” a show which was legitimately diverse and therefore immediately controversial.

Here's where we get to the meat of the article.

I'm a fan of Star Trek: Discovery. I'll admit I was neither impressed with nor repulsed by its diversity. I feel like it has a lot of room for improvement, but its been more solid than the first seasons of a lot of the other shows. I'll also admit that Sisko is my favorite captain.  I'm intrigued by the prospect of a show with him because of his obvious talent, my love for the character,  and the prospect of finally telling stories in the post-nemesis era.

I guess what I'm wondering about here is whether or not ""older white fans"" are the only people who would enjoy this character. Is the appeal of Picard so narrow? Does the fact that they want to put out a ton of Star Trek content alter the variables in this conversation? Should Star Trek just avoid major white male characters going forward? What does everyone else think about this opinion piece?

Finally, I'd like to criticize Ani Bundel, and much of the rest of the media, for the misuse of the term ""reboot"". This is a spin off, not a reboot.",Opinion | Ani Bundel: 'Trek' reboot starring Patrick Stewart sends mixed messages on diversity,1

"I know we now have a new show and a ton of TV news these days but I'm just curious are there any really hardcore Kelvin film fans around? People who probably became fans because of those movies or joined this site to keep up with news because it does feel like those movies have taken a huge back seat.

Of course its been two years since Beyond (which was a financial disappointment) and while we are getting more news about maybe two more films I feel the hype has really died with these movies.

I also know since the film takes place in another universe and not prime where most of us really care about it makes it even easier to think less about them now that we are getting some new stories in the prime universe. 

It could be a number of factors but I'm just curious am I reading that wrong or is it just lack of news in general that has turned down the discussion? Are there hardcore fans counting the days down to the next Kelvin film or has the movie franchise turned into a shrug with most folks?

Okay, I decided I'm to keep a tally for the thread in case many add in:

Love and cherish the films like they were their kids: 28

"Mr. Kurtzman, 

First, thank you so much for what you've done for Star Trek so far.  I know we fans have not always been kind but other than perhaps JJ Abrams I'm not sure there's any one person who has done more to advance the franchise since Enterprise went off the air.

In 2009 I attended the opening night of your first Star Trek movie.  The buzz for the film was great, and the overwhelming happiness and positive vibe in that theater waiting for the film to start was like nothing I've ever experienced.  Even better, your film delivered.  Everyone left happy and hopeful for the future of Star Trek.  

Convincing Sir Patrick to return to the role of Jean Luc Picard also could not have been an easy thing to do, and it speaks to your considerable skill as an executive producer that you were able to achieve it.  

I was in the pavilion in Vegas when you introduced him sitting just a few seats down from the guy who yelled ""Holy SHIT!"" When Sir Patrick made his appearance the emotion was overwhelming and yet another feeling I've never had before.  That's twice you've pulled that trick, so again, thank you.

All that said, as a lifelong Trek fan and as a person who grew up with Jean Luc Picard as a hero and role model, I have two humble requests as you conceive this new chapter in his adventures.

First, while any reasonable fan should certainly respect the need to establish conflict, the necessity for there to be high stakes, and a problem to be overcome, please don't go ""Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi"" with the character.  A major flaw in Generations was pointless offscreen death of Picard's family.  I understand the writers' goal of making him face his mortality, but it was a cheap and frankly lazy way to achieve it at the expense of the character and that narrative.  

Obviously, not everything since ""All Good Things"" could have gone perfectly for Picard and I expect in two decades he'll have seen his share of failure and regret, but there should also have been fulfillment and achievement.  

Whatever situation he finds himself in when the series begins, I hope Picard's existing life can play the role of being something he must sacrifice to address whatever the driving conflict of the series ends up being.  As a character, he deserves good things in his life as the choices he makes and the manner in which he conducts himself should have met with reward in a society like the Federation.

Please don't have him sad, broken, or in exile due to some horrible thing he did or that happened to him post-Nemesis.  Rather, consider starting the series showing the kind of rewards behaving as a truly decent and honorable leader can bestow.  His character has always embodied an ideal leader and man whose discipline, even temper, and unemotional decision making allowed him to overcome every obstacle the cosmos and humanity ever threw at him.  His position following TNG should reflect that.  

If he's not a high ranking Starfleet officer, he could be a beloved professor, an accomplished archaeologist, the governor of a colony on the frontier, any number of things.  He will almost certainly need to leave this life behind to address whatever issues form the basis of the series' conflict, and I hope you'll use the fact that his life is wonderful to illustrate how high the stakes must be for him to need to step away from it.

Second, we don't need to know how he dies.

Until recently, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo lived forever in our minds.  I would be happy for James Kirk to have done so as well.  Logan was an excellent movie, but a death like Professor X's for Picard wouldn't do any service to the character or the fans.  

I hope that however long this new series ends up being we see a character who has done so much good for everyone he has come into contact with can end up satisfied and happy, and again ride off into the sunset on a hopeful note like he did at the end of TNG.

"I recently finished rewatching voyager and started reading about the drama that transpired behind the scenes regarding Seven’s character. Not only did I discover that there is an active base of fans that strongly oppose her addition to the series, but it was also a popular opinion amongst the members of the cast, which did not like the idea of her sexualized character. 

My issue with this is... who exactly is doing the sexualizing here? Like the old saying goes, it really takes two to tango. I must agree, the actress is undeniably beautiful, but so is the bloody statue of David...but I can’t see anything sexual about either of them. In the beginning and all throughout most of the series, Seven had less of a sexual/romantic drive than Data... and that’s saying a lot. She, as a character, is not even aware of her own sexuality for the most part of the series. 

The fans, on the other hand, seem very adept at projecting their own...ehm...projections onto her character, despite the fact the nothing that she ever does or says come off as even remotely sexual, unless you have the imagination and hormones of a 13 years old. 

Janeway on the other hand, has a charming flirtatious personality. She is an actual healthy, human female who is aware of her sexuality and bound to the same biological instincts as all humans are. I felt much stronger sexual energy emanating from Janeway as a character than I’ve seen from Seven...who always seemed more like a child to me than anything else. Even Kes was more mature than her from an emotional and romantic point of view. 

And before anyone says anything about her catsuits and body etc, again, I must state the example of the statue of David. Yes, she has very desirable figure, and the catsuits sure do make a point of that, but she is not aware of her own sexuality or body. The audience is. A similar case to this is fetishizing vulcan ears. Vulcans themselves probably would be weirded out by someone actually sexualizing their ears. For them it’s just something that’s part of their body, no different than knees and elbows. 

Also, it’s not like they could have chosen an actress with a less appealing body, because it would contradict the borg idea of perfection. Their bodies are engineered to be perfect, from height to muscularity, metabolism, bones etc And since they all live, in a sense, naked, I guess it makes sense for Seven to wear simple catsuits that only serve as a way to cover her body. 

But I digress, I’ll I’m trying to say here is that I don’t believe her character was in any way sexual, but the audience interpreted it as such, because, I stated before, she is simply just beautiful. Any thoughts? ",What always bugged me about the Seven/Janeway dichotomy,1

Here's the truth of the matter, old Trek is never coming back, as much as you and I would love for that to happen, it will not, Paramount has to make money, and unfortunately, old Trek doesn't make enough money to warrant continuation.

Now, when JJ Abrams' Star Trek 2009 and Into Darkness came out, I hated them because they didn't respect the Star Trek franchise, they bastardized established characters, for me, Abrams' Trek was an unbalanced mess, they tried to put in more action and less science, because of that, the movies didn't feel like Star Trek at all.

However, DIS actually feels like ST, the characters, plot, story, etc, it feels like ST and we should be grateful for that, grateful that DIS actually respects the ST franchise and doesn't make ST into a Star Wars wannabe.

I'm glad science and discovery wasn't something they lost sight on while developing the series. With a new Picard focused series being confirmed I'm elated that we will have more trek.

"Hello, r/startrek! I'm wondering if anyone knows where I could find a copy of the rejected Star Trek: TNG script for the episode ""Blood and Fire"". Its controversial themes seem interesting, and I'm curious what the episode was like. It is an episode of TNG, after all. ",Blood and Fire,1

"With the news that Patrick Stewart will reprise his iconic role as Jean-Luc Picard, there will be many newcomers to the series. Many of these newcomers will be younger folks who never saw Star Trek: The Next Generation when it first ran in the 80s and 90s, and there will likely be a return to the fold of fans who left the series after the TNG era ended.

There will be a lot of people looking for a list of great Picard episodes to watch. I'd like to aim this list at newcomers, rather than ""hard core"" fans. This is a list for those who want a quick introduction to the character of Jean-Luc Picard without watching the entire run of TNG.

There is some overlap with any list of overall Best Episodes of TNG, but I would argue there are some key differences between a list of best TNG and best Picard episodes. For starters, with this list I will focus on those that showcase Picard's character and Stewart's performance. Still, this list will draw only from""better"" TNG episodes. So, while arguably ""Encounter at Farpoint"" does an excellent job of introducing many aspects of Picard's character, I would argue that it's not a great episode, so it's not on this list. Similarly, ""Attached\*"" is nowhere near a top episode of the series, but it is on this list because it's such an important episode for the character, Jean-Luc Picard.

Without further ado:

THE TEN BEST JEAN-LUC PICARD EPISODES (in chronological order)

1. The Measure of a Man
2. Who Watches the Watchers\*
3. The Drumhead
4. Darmok
5. The First Duty
6. The Inner Light
7. Chain of Command, Part II
8. Tapestry
9. Attached
10. All Good Things...

\*If you're a total newcomer to Star Trek, and you're reading this because you want to understand why there is so much excitement over Patrick Stewart's return to the franchise, I would start with ""Who Watches the Watchers."" It shows what Trek really is--a voyage to a strange, new world, and it introduces the ethics and morality embedded in the series overall, all while showcasing the leadership style and personality of Captain Picard. Like many episodes of the series, the writing is strong, but it's really the performance of Patrick Stewart that elevates the material. It's a fantastic episode, and it feels just as relevant and well-produced in 2018 as it did in 1989 when it first aired.

"Let me start by saying that I haven't been a lifetime Star Trek fan. My dad would watch some episodes of TOS with me when I was younger if they were the only watchable thing on TV. I watched TNG for the first time last year and I absolutely love it, it's now one of my favorite shows of all time.

&amp;nbsp;

Once finished TNG, I decided to watch the rest of the series, starting with DS9. At first, not unlike the beginning of TNG, I found myself getting bored with most of the episodes. How can you compare just finishing TNG with some of the best episodes of a show to the beginning of a whole new series? Later episodes of season 3 started to change how I felt about the show, but season 4 has solidified DS9 as another amazing show. I am almost to the end of the season, but I had to talk about it. I feel like every character in the show has been getting great development episodes now. Two episodes that stand out to me are ""Crossfire"" and ""Body Parts."" 

&amp;nbsp;

I am usually sitting at home by myself watching the show, which does get quite lonely at times, but allows me to react aloud without weird looks from my roommates. At the end of ""Crossfire"" I had to pause the show. Odo's situation with Major Kira is paralleling my life right now, so it really got to me when he wished to break up their friendship instead of telling her how he feels about her. I just finished ""Body Parts"" and I actually teared up. I've never been a huge fan of Quark up until this point, but seeing how defeated he is at the end of the episode really got to me. When everyone on the station starts bringing him things to re-stock the bar I felt like, at least for a second, that he was grateful to have so many friends who cared about him. 

&amp;nbsp;

I never expected to have much of an emotional attachment to the characters in DS9 like I did with the ones in TNG. I honestly believe that season 4 of DS9 really shows how amazing a 40 minute story can be. You're able to humanize every character to the point that you can relate to nearly all of them on some level. I am excited to continue watching and can't wait for more amazing episodes!
",Currently watching DS9 for the first time. Season 4 has really changed my opinion about the show.,1

"Patrick Stewart's announcement regarding a new Trek series featuring an older Jean-Luc Picard unleashes lots of speculations about new storylines and about potential TNG, DS9, and VOY characters who will make guest-appearances in the new series.

Many fans are expressing curiosity about possible relationship an older Picard will have in the new series. Long-term shippers are certainly hoping that Picard will finally settle down w/Dr Beverly Crusher, as imagined in the Trek novel series (which while giving a happy ending for the couple, sadly is not considered as a proper canon Trek).

Who would you like to see Picard having a relationship with in the new series. Will he marry the good Doctor by then, or would it be similar to what was portrayed in 'All Good Things' where they have divorced and she's now the Captain of the USS Pasteur? (keeping in mind 'All Good Things' just a possible future universe for an older Picard which was set up by Q).

Would you like to see Picard reconnected with some of the women he dated during TNG (e.g., Vash or Nella Darren (sadly TPTB would need to recast her, as the actress portraying Cdr Darren has sadly passed away). Perhaps a returning Ro Laren? (a good way to bring Michelle Forbes back to the Trek univese). And the unthinkable - but very interesting to watch - is that Picard will initiate a relationship with his long-term archnemesis Q :-). 

If you prefer to see him dating a new character in the new series, do you have any suggestions on who she would be to make his storyline more interesting?

"Hey all,

Given that Discovery has been largely poor at displaying alien races beyond the initial Federation founders, and explaining the state of the galaxy, is anyone else concerned the new Picard series may be lacking in details?

If we’re going 20 years post-Nemesis, I’d expect a lot of shakeup in the political elements of the universe, but I can’t help but feel we’re going to get very few details on this, and nowhere near the world building we experienced with TNG/DS9/VOY.

Here's what I've got so far as possible directions for his character in the new show. Hit me with whatever other ideas you've got, mine are *mostly* serious.

1. Captain Picard - still Captain of the Enterprise (or another science/exploration vessel). We get more of the same, a nice familiar Trek. 
2. Admiral Picard - we get more of a political thriller type vibe as now Admiral Picard adjusts to life behind a desk and the political machinations of Star Fleet that were formerly behind the scenes for the most part.
3. Governor/Administrator Picard - Now tasked with running a Federation colony, possibly a space station or science outpost, maybe even a military base. More in line with DS9.
4. Indiana Picard - Picard 'retires' to his old standby - Archeology! We get Indiana Jones in space, possibly with a small crew Picard explores the galaxy's archaeological sites.
5. Farmer Picard - once again Picard returns to his family's vineyards in France, and we get a cooking/homestead/lifestyle/gardening show. I'd watch it.",Theorizing: Picard's new direction in the upcoming series,1

"If you got to sit down with CBS and Patrick Stewart to pitch your idea for his new Star Trek series, what would it be?

My Hot Take:

Picard left the captain's chair ten years ago, taking a position as admiral, spending the last decade sticking his finger in every galactic dike you can imagine. The Klingons are on the prowl, the Romulans in disarray, Dominion skirmishes, etc. In the past 20 years Starfleet has moved far away from its mission of exploration, and has become a default military body by necessity.

Picard is sick of it. He can't worry about the politics anymore. He can't preside over wing after wing of exploding Miranda-class ships. He resigns his commission. He takes up a teaching position at the Daystrom Institute Archaeological Council. He wants to get back in the field, boldly going, etc. Starfleet, closing down several of its fleet museums, offers him the old Stargazer to use as a research vessel, but can offer very little in the way of logistics and support, and he'll need to find his own crew.  


He wanders into a bar on Deep Space Nine to find a bearded, sad looking drunk talking the patrons' ear off about the galaxy. ""You can go to the Gamma Quadrant? Big Whoop. I've seen it. I've seen everything. You know what's out there? Death. Decay. I've seen shit."" A voice from behind him. ""Shut up Wesley""  


Wesley Crusher is no longer with the Traveler. He wasn't psychologically strong enough to take the things he saw and broke down. Picard hires him as his first officer, and they set out discovering basically the weird-ass history of the Galaxy, from the Iconians to the origins of the Borg, to who ever those dudes were who ""seeded"" the galaxy.

"I enjoyed Nemesis more than First Contact and First Contact more than Insurrection.

It's not contrarianism, and I love Frakes, but I found myself somewhat bored by the whole Die Hard thriller of FC. Maybe it's because I knew there were no real stakes having seen it many times before, and FC was one of my first Star Trek experiences but many years later it just doesn't hold up like the TOS films do. 

Picard is pissed off, he's riddled with PTSD, the Borg queen is using sexuality to manipulate Data, Lily is the voice of reason...yawn. The best parts for me were the intensity of the Deflector sequence (I didn't remember it very well and while I sort of knew Hawk was going to be redshirted, I didn't remember when) and Riker being tired of Zefram Cochrane's shit on Earth. 

I don't really care for the Borg, so a Borg movie is naturally not going to excite me - but I enjoy and rewatch the Voyager Borg episodes regularly (they're the only episodes of Voyager I do rewatch tbh) because for all that show's problems, nerfing the Borg by making them defeatable and somewhat humanizing and fleshing them out (ha!) was not one of them. 

People meme the Borg as cyborg zombies, but they strike me more as space-vampires - the little nanoprobe infection in the neck is a key visual reference to this. They infect you, you become one of them - it's just they're also zombie-like in their implacability and inscrutable motivations. I'm getting off-track.

Objectively, of course, FC is easily the best of the TNG films - it's well directed, the plot is cohesive, everything ties up in a neat bow at the end, it's got memorable lines and sequences and all the characters have something to do. *Assimilate THIS* lmao. Classic Worf, eat any good books lately? 

The reason why I liked Nemesis more I think has to do with a personal preference for Romulans over Borg and Shinzon as a villain and the theme of duality over the Borg Queen as a villain and the theme of revenge. Revenge was done marvelously in WoK, and while Nemesis retread Tapestry in a way, at least it went in a different direction than ""What if PICARD were the Khan in this scenario?!"" It's a good movie, but not my favorite of the TNG films but it does have my favorite moment in almost all the films - when Reg gushes to Dr. Cochrane, it just felt like a win, like if I ended up back in time and got to shake the Gracchi Brother's hands for inventing the grain dole (little rusty on my Roman history so bear with me.) 

That being said, I would rewatch FC over Insurrection any day.

Insurrection has a great premise, but the execution is so *dull.* For one thing, I find it incredible unlikely that the Federation would **EVER** sanction the forced removal of a people from a planet to curry favor with a group that is supplying the Dominion with Ketracel White - for what, a fountain of youth? The Federation, who have strict (and possibly infuriatingly annoying) genetic engineering rules based on one member world's pre-warp fuck-up, are going to go all Andrew Jackson so that the Dominion has one less Ketty White pump instead of, oh Idk, *blowing it up?* 

Another problem I had with it was the Ba'ku did little to engender sympathy with me. I could grok Picard's lust for vengeance in FC all day and night, as a former street kid who got used to seeing people my own age born into a world of privilege compared to my shitty hand I totally understood Shinzon's issues - but the Ba'Ku are space-amish who lucked out on a planet with fountain of youth rays. The only reason I sympathized with them at all was that the Son'a were total dicks, the Admiral was a total dick, and the Federation went against its very nature to remove them by sanctioning the alliance with the Son'a in the first place - otherwise they were boring space amish. 

I get it - the Son'a are on a timetable, and the lead Son'a (a villain so forgettable I don't know his name) wants revenge (good god does the film series never leave that one behind), and the Ba'ku have a right to the world they settled before the Federation really even existed...but at the same time, why do I actually care if they're removed or not aside the fact that *the Federation went against its own ideals to do it?* 

Like that's all there is to it, so much so that I've repeated myself three times! That's the movie! It's always memed as a glorified two-parter and that judgement is not wrong at all. The plot twist (OMG they're former ba'ku who rejected space-amishism!) is weak, because alright, they want to be immortal - but as soon as they leave their planet that's over. They'd have to return periodically if they decided they wanted to run a space empire - why don't the ba'ku have space rumspringa? Let the ones who want to experience the galaxy go out and have a couple decades of life on the spacelanes then decide if they want to be mortal or not? If fantasy and sci-fi has taught me anything, it's that an empire run by an elite caste of immortals dependent on a macguffin to retain their status and immortality is doomed to have their special planet carpet bombed. 

Is this ever addressed? Hell no, Big Son'a Dick just wants his revenge and throws a few fits - never does reconciliation enter his mind, what an asshole. I get Picard going ""oh you're actually warp-capable if you want to be? Uh, sorry. We'll leave. Our bad."" because we know Federation policy thanks to the episode First Contact. If you know about the wider galaxy and reject Federation hospitality and exchange, fine, call us if you change your mind, have a nice day. 

Ugh what a shit movie. 

I sort of liked how Riker and Troi got back together, that was a long time coming, but...it was kind of hashed together real quick and I feel like it should have come earlier. Also how funny would it have been if in FC, Riker ended up doing the nasty in the past-y? Ha. 

This is an awful write up so don't remind me. ",First Contact and Insurrection: some thoughts,1
"Jean-Luc was great at many things.  A man for all seasons.  But the thing that he excelled in the most and which I believe Patrick Stewart is most suited for as an actor, especially at his current age, is ambassador.  

One advantage of being an ambassador in the Federation is that they aren’t limited to one planet in the way Earth ambassadors are to one country.  But let’s bring it up a notch...

Picard should be in command of a vessel and even a group of vessels (perhaps with a not-too-distant rescue/escort group) in a position that solidifies the UFP mission of “seeking out new life and new civilizations” and making first contact or servicing relations with potential new allies or stubbornly neutral civilizations.  

His title should be something like “(Forward) Ambassador-General of the UFP.”  This should be considered a rank equivalent to a 4 bar admiral, answering only to SF command and the UFP council.

Don’t think for a second this will be boring.  First contact missions as well as diplomatic relations missions with worlds that have conflicted internal politics should prove extremely interesting.  

The show should also pass back and forth between HQ and Picard’s Diplomatic Ship Group and the various commanders, scientists, linguists, and other team diplomats.  An undercurrent of some secretive conspiratorial cabal at HQ who doesn’t want to make any more contact with “new aliens” because it is too great a security threat would be good too.

And it would be really great if we could get Deanna Troi (Preferably Marina Sirtis) at a minimum to accompany him.  Wouldn’t hurt to have Data (with Brent Spiner) experimenting with age-effects to feel more human.
