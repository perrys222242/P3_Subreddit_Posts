This struck me as pretty odd that the Federation would consider this normal.

I’ve tried watching a few episodes, remaining as objective as possible, but this show seems to always leave me unsatisfied and ultimately puzzled as to what the writers were going for with a lot of the choices they made during production. It just doesn’t ‘feel’ like Star Trek to me.

I watched [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSn0d56Eqw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1m29s) scene the other day. At first, I was just confused, so I rewatched it; after the second time through, I was no less confused as to what exactly it was that I just saw, but this time i became suddenly appalled by the realization that this show carries the same name as previous installments of the franchise such as The Next Generation or even The Original Series. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m open to new ideas and even a new direction for the franchise entirely, but this just doesn’t seem right to me. I’d like some opposing opinions on the matter to consider. 

Here are some scenes from past series that are similar in nature to this one, yet, in my opinion, retain more of what I would consider the underlying themes of Star Trek as a whole: [1](https://youtu.be/JGn948_PXTU?t=1m23s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmldpYnFzw), or even [3](https://youtu.be/zlGRNRAL148?t=30s). 

For me, Star Trek Discovery is the confused grandchild of a tv show that was supposed to explore our inner selves more so than anything else. It is overly overt, distractingly glamorous, and too concerned with setting its self apart from the past that it often falls short in the areas that truly matter. 

Edit: 

1) As many of you have stated, and correctly so, Discovery is still in its infancy as a tv show. It would be wrong in saying that all the past shows did not have a rocky beginning as well, so it is best to remain open minded. However, I can say that I think out of all the shows, early season difficulties considered, Discovery still is the farthest from the rest both in terms of story telling and aesthetics. Ultimately, I will maintain a cautious yet optimistic outlook.

2) How the clips are related. 

I chose the three scenes from past Star Trek shows because, they are, at least in the most basic sense, similar in terms of subject and narrative, so there is a point of comparison to be made. Furthermore, I think there is a clear contrast between how the prior shows handled a scene like this compared to Discovery: This includes everything involved; plot, resolution, character interaction, visuals, effects, montage, camera use, etc. In full, the muse-en-scene  is what is in question. 
",What do you think about Star Trek Discovery?
33,"I started watching Star Trek for the first time last year, and I'm up to Voyager S3:E1. On the subject of Lon Suder (the homicidal + creepy Betazoid ex-Marquis), and the holographic doctor referred to him as a ""sociopath"". 


This may be a minor detail, but it's actually bothering me. He's listed as a sociopath where ever he's mentioned, but... Wouldn't it be more accurate to refer to him as a psychopath? 


As far as I'm aware, he has never shown remorse for killing his fellow crewmate. He's merely trying to control his homicidal urges. Nothing about him indicates to me that he is a ""sociopath"", yet everything about him indicates to me that he is a ""psychopath"". 


What's the deal? Did Star Trek's writers just make a mistake, and everyone just ""went with it"", and it became canon? Or am I mistaken? Technically you could call him a sociopath, but it just seems much more accurate to use the term psychopath. The medical doctor **should know the difference**. 


At best, this might be explained away by saying ""in 2373, the term psychopath no longer exists"" or something.

37,"I was watching the DS9 first season finale yesterday, In the Hands of the Prophets (still one of the most underrated season finale's ever). I was watching the scene Keiko O'Brien and evil woman Vedek Winn debate over the wormhole aliens, orbs, etc as a religion vs science issue. 

It was a good reminder how much DS9 went out of its way to create it's mini-universe within a universe. None of those concepts were ever heard of in Star Trek until DS9 introduced them. And they really built up those ideas more in later seasons. And of course their mythology got even bigger once the Dominion was introduced and gave us not just a new villain but a entire story line built around them that went on for years.

Then I started thinking about Star Trek in general and just how big the overall mythology has become because every show has added to it in some way offering up new conflicts, aliens and concepts.

All except Discovery. :(

It's crazy but it's true. Just stay with me here, but every show from TOS to Enterprise has all introduced completely new ideas and concepts to the Trek universe. Just a tiny example of what I mean:

TOS- Well it's obvious being the first it set up everything in the universe: Starfleet, Klingons. Vulcans, Romulan war, 23rd century, etc, etc. And pretty much every major element from that show has been used on most shows in some fashion. 

TNG- It's first season set up the 24th century, but also gave us the Ferengi (yeah, I know), Q, the Borg (although didn't actually see them until second season), crazy new tech like holodecks, etc. It gave us old elements from TOS like the Klingons and star ships, but it prided itself on presenting new aliens and threats in its very first season.

DS9 has been mentioned.

Voyager- LOL that entire show created multiple new species and concepts being in the Delta quadrant of course. The Borg became it's main threat in later seasons but Voyager had tons of new species to play with and created a lot stories around them like the Kazon and the Ocampa being the first major arc.

Enterprise- While it's a prequel it actually went out of its way to create a lot of new mythology and background. Being in the only show in the 22nd century basically set up that era the way TNG did with the 24th. It laid the ground work of how Starfleet was perceived in the early days of space travel. But it still went farther by giving us the Temporal Cold War and the Suliban in the first season. It introduced a completely new idea in Star Trek and different species fighting over various timelines. And then later of course we got the Xindi arc which added to TCW but were a new villain completely.

And then we get to Discovery. And sadly they have added nothing to their own like the other shows started out. The only original concept the show has created is the spore drive and mycelial network. It's completely new but it's more of a plot device instead of a brand new story line. But outside of that, what was new?  They stuck to the Star Trek tradition of introducing a new alien we never seen before in Saru but that's really it. They have filled in concepts other shows already created like the Mirror Universe and the Klingon war. Next season we're getting Section 31 but that came from DS9. 

Is it a big deal, no, since it just hit me recently they didn't do anything new but it is odd DIS for all it's talk of being 'different' and 'modern' hasn't created any truly original ideas outside of one. Even when it came to new aliens, there has basically been two introduced so far: Saru and the Phavo aliens, which we saw in one episode. We see others walk around but we know zip about them. 

So maybe next season this show will create it's own mythology unique to Discovery but so far it's seriously lagging behind the others which is weird given how all the other shows went out their way to create new villains, histories and concepts. ",My biggest disappointment in Discovery first season vs all the other shows....it didn't create any new mythology!

To put this into some context, the very first science fiction show I ever watched was West World.  That, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  I watched reruns of TOS but had to leave the room when the news came on because the Vietnam War was a thing on the news and my parents were being parents.  I loved Space: 1999 even though I questioned how the moon could travel so far through space so quickly (my mom said, ""Don't worry about it.  It's just a TV show. They do dumb stuff like that."" or words to that effect). Later I watched Dr. Who (Tom Baker is my Doctor, the others are pale imitations).  I read Heinlein and Asimov and Bova and Pournelle and Niven. I knew what Science Fiction was.

And Star Trek just wasn't science fiction.  Sure, it was futuristic, sort of.  It had gee whiz bang effects.  But it wasn't *science* fiction. I have tried watching all the newer Star Trek fare but it just doesn't sit right with me.  All too often I pop on an episode, excited for the spectacle, hoping for some wonderful story to unfold, and then... nothing.

On another subreddit people were talking about plot holes and whatnot, and something someone said got me to thinking.

They told me I simply wasn't watching it correctly.  Apparently it is necessary to 'forget' things you know to enjoy shows these days.

I’m having a hard time giving a shit. It’s a rehash of old Trek content in a show with a very good premise.

People say DS9 sucks for two seasons but I thought s1 was the best first season in Trek besides TOS and I thought s2 was one of the best in the franchises history. 

So I thought I could watch Voyager and enjoy it despite what people say but nope. This is boring. Help.",Having a hard time getting through Voyager
73,"Since I know people will ask, here's some examples;

The Animated Series introduced a Caitian and Edosian.

The Next Generation introduced the first Klingon and (half) Betazoid main cast member (and android if you count them as species)!

It seems like most of Deep Space Nine were first of their species main cast members; Trill, Bajoran, Changeling, Ferengi, etc.

Voyager had our first Ocampa and Talaxian, of course.

Enterprise had our first Denobulan.

Discovery introduced our first Kelpien main character.



With that out of the way, I ask you! Of the species we have seen in universe at least once, what not already featured as a main cast character do you hope to see in Picard's show (I believe it's believed to be called Star Trek: Reliant or Destiny?)","Since each Star Trek series has introduced a character to the main cast of a species that was not a main character in a previous series, what species do you hope is the first in the new Picard series?"
74,"Don't get me wrong; I love Picard. But he does sometimes feel... conflicted in his ethics.  


""Even life itself is an exercise in exceptions!"" was his words when he saved Wesley from execution.

75,"I saw ST II: Wrath of Khan long before watching TOS ""Space Seed"", Khan's origin episode.

I was fairly shocked at the actual ending of that initial conflict, how patient and forgiving Kirk was with Khan during his trial and before! Spock was much more vocally combative throughout the episode, although it's revealed to be somewhat at the behest of Kirk.

And in the end, Kirk lets Khan keep his people, his new hostage/lover, and his dignity (all at a loss to Starfleet in retrospect). Based off WoK, I had thought Kirk was MUCH harsher in this scenario.

So it can be said the Kirk/Khan conflict is mostly one-sided, ""white whale-ish"" to an insane degree, and stems from Khan's necessity  for a nemesis who can match his wits.  

Kirk's only mistake in creating his ""arch-nemesis"" was presenting himself intelligently and respectfully.","TOS ""Space Seed"" Kirk treated Khan as well as possible"

What if instead of Founders there were a race of positronic androids?

My personal one would either be a Star Trek: Intelligence or Star Trek: Corps of Engineers (basically MASH with spanners and wrenches).

My character is outfitted with a mind control device and I'm ordered to assist in implementing tech into other Romulans.

The dialog options have me the choice to resist. So I did. And I kept doing it, purposely sabotaging the implants. As time wore on, my sabotages became more violent and brutal. And eventually it dawned on me. In resisting, I'm causing greater harm to, and perhaps killing others. If I continued to resist, I'd be causing more suffering.

So I conceded. I stopped harming them.and followed orders. They won and beat me. They had control. Well, at least until my friends got me out. Hey, you need agency in a game, after all.

This mission has stuck with me more than the others. It forced me to stop and think about my decisions. Was I doing the right thing? Or was I putting my well being above those around me?

Overall this series has just been incredible. Amazing characters and great long running stories. I think I was most impressed by the ""villains"" of the show which I only state that way because this is absolutely a show about change. Watching someone like Damar and the way he goes from background extra, to hated POS, to savior is just amazing. And of course Kai Winn is just one of the best written characters ever. And the crew is great to, especially Jadzia who is everything I aspire to be. Also Bashir and O'Brien forever. Like any Star Trek show it wasn't perfect, but I just loved it all so much along the way!

\#ReleaseDS9onBluRay",My friends and I just posted our final episode of our Deep Space Nine watch-along podcast. All three of us can safely now say it's our favorite Star Trek show.
94,"Besides casting minorities, what made TOS so revolutionary? I know it is, but I'm curious, like, from a historical standpoint, did TOS really change television forever, etc.? Were the scripts really outstanding for that time period (I mean, the writing is still great for today, so)?",What made TOS so revolutionary?
95,"I really really enjoy the characters and situations in this series, especially the crazy mind warping episodes (usually involving some kind of anomaly or universe shifting), and I was hoping other series followed a similar trend of episode styles. I'm in love with all of the characters and the developments they went through and progress of everything, and while I know others don't believe the new generation is the best series, it's set a pretty high standard for what I would want in a star trek series. Based on that, what's the next best series to carry on these qualities I love?

Edit: I have watched some of the original series but not all of it. It was a while ago but my fiance wasn't really into it so we moved on, it was about a year later a picked up tng. He wanted to watch it for whoopi goldberg, I wanted to watch it for Patrick Stewart.","I am just about to finish TNG, and I've seen lots of posts recommending the next step. But do any other seasons bear similarities to this?"
96,"Just curious out there but what do people consider when Star Trek was at it's peak? I don't mean just ratings and popularity (although that can certainly be included of course) but when you felt Trek was at it's best? Or most exciting?

And I don't mean just one show but the franchise in general? And maybe a span of 10 years, give or take a few. You can start from the first year when TOS started all the way up until now (since the Kelvin films have been around 9 years now and Discovery has started). 

For me personally, I think it's 1990 to 2000. That was a rich history of Trek for a number of reasons:

A. This was when TNG came into it's element, specifically in 1990 because that was around it's third season and when the show took off both creatively and popularity. 

B. While TUC wasn't the best TOS film, it was damn near close and was a great way to end those adventures. And 1991 was the 25th anniversary of the franchise marking a pivotal moment.

C. DS9 premiered in 1993 and turned into one of the best shows IMO. And it finished in the year 2000. It also showed that Star Trek could just do more than fly in star ships and we started to see cracks in Federation virtue.  Sadly haven't gotten a show like it since.

D. While not super successful TNG launched into films and did give us one of the biggest events in Trek history, having Kirk and Picard in the same film in Generations. For people who were around back then this did feel monumental in so many ways. A Star Trek film made the cover of Time Magazine. That said a lot. First Contact is still one of the best Trek films and was a great tie in to the 30th anniversary putting the Borg on the big screen. Sadly I have not been as excited about a Trek film since. 

E. Voyager premiering in 1995. Yes the show isn't as great as the others but it's still a great show. And Voyager actually created a few milestones on its own. It was the first Star Trek show since TOS to premiere on a network, 29 years later. It's pilot, Caretaker, to this day is the most watched Trek pilot with around 22 million viewers. And that was a relief because it was also the most costliest Trek pilot lol. One of the costliest period at $23 million. In 1995 at that. To this day only two other pilots cost more: Game of Thrones and Westworld. And yes our first woman Captain! 

E. And this probably was when Trek was at it's most popular in regards to merchandise and awareness. I remember walking into a Toys R Us back in 97 and there was an shelf devoted to Star Trek. Models, toys, games, etc. This was when new characters would show up after an episode aired and thrown up on shelves. You could buy Star Trek everything from clocks to bed sheets. And I was personally buying this stuff. I had my own Star Trek shelf of toys, episodes and movies, soundtracks, books, trading cards and even the Star Trek communicator magazine. Yes HUGE nerd lol! 

For me, this was definitely when I think Trek was at it's golden age. There was just always something going on. Trek felt mainstream in the sense you turn on a TV it was on somewhere. Because so many new shows were coming out new fans were always finding it. They still find it like here but at that time it was already so big that it I knew someone who was watching some of it if not all. 

But like I said, this is just my opinion. Some people it may be when TOS started and when fandom was just getting going through the first TOS film. Others my think it was when TWOK hit theaters and had a good run through TUC. Some may even think the first Kelvin film gave us a new and different era from all of those and made Trek mainstream it never was before.

Using both full impulse and the Reliant's drift to put the maximum amount of distant between the two ships, before the explosion, would have made more sense.

110,"I've decided to start my newbie kind of overview. I will write one at the end of every season I watch.

So first off, we start off with:

Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 1 -  \_\_\_  episodes

**Best 5 Episodes - Best to Worst**

1. Datalore
2. Conspiracy
3. 11001001
4. Arsenal of Freedom
5. The Neutral Zone

Explanation: Datalore was amazing to me, honestly, I loved all of it, especially that last transporter fight with Wesley, Lore, and Data. Conspiracy was very memorable and very dark and engaging. 11001001 was just overall a good episode, with cool aliens, and a believable plot. Arsenal of Freedom was also a good episode, with character development for Geordi, and more on Crusher and Picard. The Neutral Zone was anti climatic, but the beginning was amazing. The music in the meeting room close to the beginning was perfect. And it also hinted on the Borg, as well.

Honorable Mentions:

Home Soil: Loved this fun detective episode

Heart of Glory: Gave us background on Worf and Klingons.

The Battle: Also a great episode, but it always gives me a headache, not because it is bad, but because Picard had headaches.

**Worst 5 Episodes - Worst to Best**

1. Code of Honor
2. The Naked Now
3. Angel One
4. Justice
5. When the Bough Breaks

Explanation: Code of Honor was not just boring, but also a plain racist story, The Naked Now was weird and the plot wasn't too intriguing, it was a rehash of the Naked Time. Angel One was also sexist, in a way, with the whole men-women thing flipped around, and the B-plot, the cold, was kind of... silly, Justice was hard to believe, and very corny and silly, what with Wesley falling into flowers... And When the Bough Breaks was full of plotholes, like why do they just pick so little children, wouldn't they have picked more?  Sorry if that wasn't a lot, but there isn't really that much to say.

​

**Bonuses:**

​

Most overrated = The Big Goodbye

Not saying it is bad, but some parts of it was sort of boring and I thought it wasn't as good as a lot of other episodes, still in the higher range for Season 1, but not the best.

Also: Hide and Q

Good episode, but still not really **that** good.

Also: Where No One Has Gone Before

I didn't really find it to be all that good, unfortunately. Some parts of it were boring.

​

Most memorable = Conspiracy

What with exploding heads and eating parasites, of course this is very memorable!

​

**Conclusion:**

Well, I guess that's all! Remember, this is my opinion and is not a general guide or anything, I recommend watching all the episodes, like for me, Justice and When the Bough Breaks weren't half as bad as I thought they would be.

I'm marking as spoiler because I don't know if this counts or not.

Also, I'm a noob Trekkie, so don't be too hard on me. Hope you all Live Long and Prosper!

122,"I had my M-5 multitronic unit, which I picked up for a song on eBay some years ago, analyze and rank the six Star Trek TV series theme songs in order of best to worst. As always, the M-5's results are [foolproof and incapable of error](https://youtu.be/AD8YvY7PqYY?t=53s).

1. [**Star Trek: Voyager**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtVXAugaSm0)**.** Dennis McCarthy's haunting theme never fails to send a shiver up my spine. In less than two minutes McCarthy manages to convey both the existential sadness and the shining optimism that drives the good ship *Voyager*, trapped 75 years away from everything any of its crew have ever loved in this life, to find a way to cheat physics and get themselves the hell home.
2. [**Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc_0ii3SLp0)**.** This was going to be my number one entry until I remembered that Voyager was a thing. The amazing Dennis McCarthy once again comes through with a theme that's perfect for a lonely space station located on--deal with it, Kira--the galactic frontier. McCarthy is at his best when he gets to work with an Aaron Copland-esque wonder at the unknown, and he delivers here in spades.
3. [**Star Trek**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjL8WXjlGI)**.** This is where it all began, and it pains me to rank it third out of six. Alexander Courage's genuinely timeless fourteen-note intro has become one of the most recognizable musical motifs of the twentieth century, a feat that becomes more jaw-droppingly amazing the more one thinks about it, and is directly quoted in the themes of two of its successor series. Alas, its greatness is marred by the somewhat dated main theme that follows, which in TOS's second and third seasons features vocalising that... well, it's a product of its time, let's leave it at that.
4. [**Star Trek: Discovery**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcTvrxwP6Is)**.** The newcomer comes through with a surprisingly strong entry from composer Jeff Russo. Let's be honest here: The Discovery theme is a mess, but it's a glorious mess. Russo starts by acknowledging just two notes of Alexander Courage's iconic, half-century-old TOS theme, then launches into an entirely new composition that is nevertheless informed by at least three Berman-era themes, only to return a minute later to Courage's timeless signature. I nearly cried the first time I heard it. No lie.
5. [**Star Trek: The Next Generation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsxgcLf0TSY)**.** The good news is that it starts with Alexander Courage's classic fanfare. The bad news is that it's followed up by Jerry Goldsmith's recycled theme for TMP, which was showing its age even in 1987. To 2018 ears,  it comes across as bombastic nonsense to the point of self-parody. Look, I know that for many of you TNG was your first exposure to Trek and this theme will always hold a place in your heart, but the sooner you come to terms with the fact that the theme is complete crap, the better. Rarely have I been more grateful for Netflix's ""Skip Opening Credits"" option.

True confession time: I genuinely have only heard this theme song in its entirety approximately twice, because I owned a TiVo DVR back in 2001, and I only ever needed to hear this fragrant piece of shit once or twice before it became abundantly clear that I never, ever needed to hear it again. So fuck you, Diane Warren, I don't give a shit how goddamn long of a road it's fucking been, and I never will. I--Jesus, I'm legitimately getting angry about this, and it's been seventeen years.

124,"Hello again! 
I am King_JoLo, and I have been running a Star Trek Text-based Roleplay for Star Trek for quite a while now and we are interested in expanding our group with more Trekkies! 

What is it?
USS Paladin is an RP server using Discord, simulating the entire deck plan of the USS Paladin, a souvereign class starship. We have 24/7 RP but the main focus lies on events, which are at least once a week with smaller ones in between. 

How does it work?
As with all RP's, you can create a character with backstory, species, etc. Once you have your character, that's it! You can begin RP at any time once your character is accepted. You will have your own quarters as well (May have a roommate). 
Besides that we use Discord's functions to create a rank and department (science, tactical, medical, operation and engineering) system and to simulate the many rooms present on a large starship. 
Additionally, we work with ""episodes and seasons"". Similar to actual Star Trek show. (For reference, we are currently in season 2 episode 18 as of writing this).

What do I need to join?
You only need three things:
1. Proper english. It doesn't have to be perfect (I'm not natively english speaking myself either), but if you can understand and replicate what's said in Star Trek shows you're good!
2. Will to RP.
3. Maturity. The server is considered 18+ (due to some romance, but you will find it limited in the ERP sense, only in quarters).

If you feel interested feel free to check out the server. If you don't rp (and of course don't cause trouble) you are always welcome to just hang out and check out our top-kek memes/game nights!

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, or (assuming you joined the server, which will explain many potential questions with a more detailed explanation and ruleset) you can PM me, or ask anyone your question in the general OOC channel.

126,"Hi everyone, 

I'm doing research for a project that requires me to find good quality images of all the captain's quarters in each series of Star Trek. For some I've done alright (TOS, TNG, even DISCO, even though I think Lorca's quarters only appeared once). However, I've exhausted what I've been able to find online, so I need to go through a few episodes on Netflix and take screenshots. But yeah, there's hundreds of episodes out there.

So, if anyone wants to help, it would save me a ton of time if you can think of any episodes of DS9, Voyager and Enterprise that have prominent scenes in the captain's quarters.

It always cracks me up that he chooses to dress in a Starfleet uniform, but I think they missed a huge opportunity here with the number of pips he wears. Like Picard (and all other captains), he wears 4 pips. But, I've always thought it would have been funnier if he wore 5, instead. Just to really show Picard, Sisko, Janeway, etc. that he is truly above them (and to mess with them even more). I think this would have been a funny, subtle little thing they could've done with Q.

137,"Before you even start. I’ve seen many a Star Trek series, TNG is my favorite, and one of my favorite shows period. Now I haven’t seen EVERY episode in quite some time so while binge viewing on YouTube I came to this, one of the more ballyhooed episodes. Now for those of you unaware, “The Inner Light” concerns Picard being knocked unconscious by a probe and living for some 40 years as a man in a doomed civilization. At first he’s focused on reaching the Enterprise, and gradually he fits in and lives a full life among them complete with family. By the end Picard returns to consciousness with the newfound knowledge of these long dead people. Firstly, from a practical perspective this is a Picard episode. That means if you watch the show because you enjoy ANY other character, you’re SOL. From a plot perspective, you’re telling me this civilization has a probe capable of this, yet spend the entire episode talking about their primitive tech and inability to send people into space?! What’s more, they apparently agreed this torture is the best method for passing on their culture. Lastly, the character of Picard falls victim to Stockholm syndrome. He has no ill-will toward his captors nor their grand duping. Totally out of character. It seems the writers were preoccupied with the concept of Picard growing old in an alternative life, letting the majority of the cast take a vacation, and not in making a complete, sensible episode.

According to some guy named Adi Shankar, producer, ""actors don't matter, stories do."" Yes, stories are important, but there's no need to trade one for the other if you can trade one actor for another (Hemsworth for Pine). If it's a matter of Pine's contract being up, that's just a standard problem to be solved and maybe it's time for an entire recast or a movie without Kirk at all.

I maybe it's old(er) age and franchise fatigue on my part, but seeing multiple actors play certain roles within a ten year span, or on TV shows versus movies (DC universe) just doesn't seem right and dilutes the general image of characters. Obviously characters being played by multiple actors is an accepted part of fictional media, but I think it should be avoided where possible.

There's a reason so many people want to see Stewart back as Picard. Even if Pine can't compare the the Shakepearean skill of Stewart, keeping the cast together for a couple movies would cement him more solidly as Kirk. Let him actually spend some time contemplating being his character instead of jumping and running around all movie and it might turn out he can act.",Actors Matter

This got me thinking, mostly around voyager needing a hydroponics bay to make food so replicator energy wasn’t used as often. what if seeds were made using the replicator systems, could they have been used to grow “earth food”. 

Perhaps possibly getting the seeds to geminate through splicing with alien plants/vegetables. We know it’s possible as Tuvox has shown in an earlier episode how he created a new type of orchard by taking cuttings from (I think it was an earth orchard) and attaching the to a Vulcan orchard; creating an entirely new plant.  

 Possible reasons to do this (in voyagers case)? Earth food dishes being more earth like (neelix tries bless him) ability to cultivate/farm more food, saves the need to trade for food/search for food. 

I know replicators can my crest “life” so not sure how this could work. 

Further to this, more of an after thought, what about using transporters to replicate living things. We know patten buffers are stored in the transporters so when someone/something is transported, de materialised  and then reintegrated it could be possible to create infinite copies. Again this is possible due to the existence of two William Rikers. Now I am not saying they could make more people but again along the terms of plants/food a transporter/replicator mash up? It could have also have solved limited resources on voyager. Sorry to keep using voyager as an example it’s what I am currently rewatching.)

179,"I recently had two very long drives (14+ hours each).  To maintain my sanity, and provide some entertainment, I picked up a bunch of Star Trek audiobooks.  For the super short summary jump to the end.

**Star Trek: The Next Generation**  
**The Genesis Wave Series**

Read by Tim Russ, this was a very entertaining series.  My TV guide summary would be: someone, somewhere, has revived the Genesis Project in a horrible new way and the crew of the Enterprise must save the galaxy.

It felt like a pretty solid multi-episode arc that you would never see on TNG when it originally aired.  I think it just requires too much ""continuity"" between franchises (it uses elements from TOS, TNG, and DS9) to work in TNG's television paradigm back in the day.  It had a great Star Trek feel, but with a greater freedom than the TV format allows.

Do you have to read/listen to all four books to get closure?  No.  Sort of.  To be fair, my recollection is a bit fuzzy due to the mindlessness of driving for 14 hours, but here's what I remember.

Book One sets up the Genesis Wave and the horrors it unleashes.  Can the Enterprise find the source?

Book Two has the Enterprise investigating the source and trying to find a way to stop it.

Book Three apparently was written later (I just learned that now!) which would explain why it felt like it could stand alone.  Basically the technology from Books One and Two has fallen into the hands of a religious zealot and new troubles arise.

Book Four is the book of Worf.  Ok that's an exaggeration.  But, I kept wondering where he was for Books 1-3, and this book answers that question.  It basically is a standalone episode focusing on one planet affected by the Genesis Wave.

Tim Russ does a great job narrating.  He doesn't do ""voices"" necessarily, but the way he voices the different characters is fantastic.  He includes speech mannerisms like pacing, emphasis, etc. Along with the author's dialogue for the characters, you can get a pretty good sense of who's talking to whom.

I did feel like the series was a bit ""darker"" than TNG I'm used to.  For example: the very premise of the book requires the destruction of several planets with large populations.  I know we've seen destruction before (Borg, the Nexus) but this felt darker.

I'd recommend books 1 and 2 if you only have a 7-hour drive.  If you've got closer to 10 hours, add book 4.  Only if you're on a really long drive, or really want a bunch of audiobooks, would I recommend book 3.

[My main complaint about Book 3 is spoiler-y:](#s ""There were a bunch of passages written where I was like 'Why is the author spending so much time describing how attractive a female alien is?' Well it turns out it's because she was manipulating Picard's mind to make him fall so desperately in love with him that he'd undo his whole career and life for her.  So it was decent writing, but I just felt like it was a really cheesy plot device.  I dunno... it just didn't work for me"")

**Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**
**Legends of the Ferengi**

Clearly a money-making tie-in of a book.  I still enjoyed it. 
 ~~Armin Shimerman~~ Quark narrates and basically it's a bunch of short stories to illustrate various Ferengi Rules of Acquisition.

Remember the episode of DS9 where they had that educational program for children and Quark was teaching them math?  It basically felt like that.  It was an entertaining way to pass an hour.

Major caveat: the audio quality on this sounds like it was pulled from a cassette tape found at a used book store.  Ok, I exaggerate slightly, but be ready to adjust your EQ and deal with 90s audio.

**Star Trek**
**Spock vs. Q: The Sequel**

I *loved* the first Spock vs Q but didn't know there was a sequel until last week.  While not as good as the first, this one still does a great job.  John De Lancie and Leonard Nimoy both sound like they had a lot of fun making this.  There's a lot of role-reversal humor in this one and while it's enjoyable, there are definitely some jokes that don't land as well.

**Star Trek**
**The Eugenics Wars: Book Two**

By mistake I picked up book two instead of book one.  But I figured it shouldn't be too hard to catch up.  After all, even the Genesis Wave books do a good job of reminding you what happened in the last book.

I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as the others.  The main thing it had going for it was Rene Auberjonois' narration.  While some of his accents aren't perfect, I felt he captured the characters' personalities well in his portrayals.  It was easy for me to know who was speaking at any time, even when I was tuned out to focus on driving.

The plot, as far as I can gather, is that Khan and his genetically-enhanced kin escaped from the facility creating them and have run amok.  Gary Seven is on the case, but apart from him barely anyone knows that the Eugenics War is even happening.  The plot spent more time on the infighting among the genetically-enhanced than any threat from them against ""normal"" humans.  When TOS or TNG refer to the Eugenics Wars they talk as if everyone knows about the horrors that took place.  But this book makes it seem like only a small number of people ever knew what was happening, and the horrors don't actually seem that bad.

I got the feeling that the Eugenics Wars were discussed in the same discussions of other atrocities of the 1980s and 1990s, and that they were all linked in the cultural memory of the Federation.  While this book does discuss the participation of the genetically-enhanced in conflicts in Bosnia, Rwanda, and American extremists, because it's all so cloak-and-dagger hidden from the rest of the world made it lose a lot of impact for me.

I think this series is probably worth skipping.

**In brief**

* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Books 1 and 2.  Recommended!  Enjoyable.  Good TNG.
* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Book 3.  Weakest of the four books.  Skippable.
* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Book 4.  Enjoyable.  Worf gets a turn.
* Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Legends of the Ferengi.  Entertaining fluff.  If you don't like Quark or the Ferengi, you won't like this.
* Star Trek: Spock vs Q: The Sequel.  Highly recommended, but not as amazing as the original.
* Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: Book Two.  Skip it.  Plot feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode ",Audiobook roadtrip review

185,"I always find it fascinating thinking about the future technology concepts star trek's writers thought up, and how we look at them at the time of conception vs the our modern day perception.

Take for instance the data padd, basically just the digital equivalent of paper. Instead of making a multi page report/document, or a book, you have this slim piece of plastic. It seems way more efficient, and overall has a nice sci fi look.

Then you see scenes like Jake Sisko is cleaning up his room and stuggling to carry a dozen of these little things, probably from his schoolwork assignments and whatnot. And in our modern day age of smartphones, you can't help but think ""why do people have multiples of these, wouldn't you just need one for all your stuff?"".

Not saying it like its a flaw on the writers, it's just something funny I've noticed as time goes on.

[EDIT] I forgot to add that Dax also has a Lesbian affair with her wife from a previous lifetime. 
I’m thrilled that Discovery finally has a gay character but it’s too little too late. 
As a gay man my favorite character and the character who I think most represented LGBT culture is Lwaxana Troi, she is fabulous, fashionable, outrageous, sassy and always wearing the latest styles, in some ways she reminds me of a Drag Queen and I plan to attend my next Trek Con as Lwaxana in Drag! Overall Star Trek is amazing and tackled many social issues but it’s sad that we had to wait til 2017 to see a gay character. Voyager ran into the 2000s when homosexuality was allowed on TV.

It's a wonderful episode about Sisko's mentor, Admiral Layton, taking advantage of the fear of a Dominion Invasion and faking one so he can declare martial law over Earth and, essentially, form a military dictatorship. His reasoning (and I believe he is sincere, if a bit deluded) is that is The Federation waits until they actually NEED StarFleet to control Earth it will be too late. Being the Supreme Commander over Earth is also appealing, I'm sure.

Of course, Sisko and Odo uncover the plot and end it before Layton can take over, and they are right to do so.

Before i start, I just want to say Kes was absolutely one of my favorite characters. I knew she left the show at some point, and at first, it didn't bother me. This all changed once I started season 3 and I was blown away. Kes became an amazing character. I think she should've been left on an M class planet and remained in touch with Tuvok. Once she regained control of her powers, she could've come back. I know it wouldn't 100% work, but it would've been better in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just started the Year in Hell two parter, and it feels wrong without Kes. Ignoring the whole Jennifer Lein got fired or quit controversy, I understand why Kes isn't there (to some extent). Kes and Tom got married and Janeway and B'Elanna die in the alternate version. If Kes survived, there's a chance those same events would've occurred, but that does not make it absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys haven't heard, the original idea was for the Year in Hell to be an arc spanning a few episodes (like the Dominion War in the last season of DS9). Since Lein decided not to renew her contract, the idea was scrapped. Personally, I think they should have gone with the arc idea. It would've made the danger more real (if that makes sense). I think part of why they didn't was because Berman was one of the producers, and he hated the Dominion War arc.

258,"Love it or loathe it, Discovery is at least here for a 2nd series. 

Personally, I like the show but it took a 2nd binge watch on Netflix to get there. However, it has many many issues that just do not fit with Trek cannon.  Now....I could nit pick each and every issue but I'm just going to focus on the one major issue in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Warning: Spoilers ahead! 

&amp;#x200B;

The Spore drive! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...I like the idea of the Spore drive. It's interesting, opens up numerous possibilities.....but so help me it spits in the face of all other Trek.  I'm just going to put this in perspective for a moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Federation (or at least Stamets) makes an engine that allows Discovery to go anywhere in the universe in the blink of an eye using the  *mycelial network* which inhabits subspace. Obviously it has issues as we learn in the show (mostly caused by Lorca) but it's viable. Used correctly and  sparingly, you can jump to any location in the universe. Hammer and abuse it and then it's not only reality hopping but time hopping as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, it's not something we ever heard of in later Trek shows. You would think Janeway would have risked making and using one to get home. You'd even think that the Federation would adopt Spore drives when it's found that Warp travel is collapsing subspace in TNGs  ""Force of Nature"" episode. You can also be damn sure the Borg would give their left nipple nut for Spore Drive tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...the easy hand wave scenario here is that the Spore Drive is abandoned and / or classified after whatever events take place in Discovery. Again, this makes no sense. The Federation knows it works  (it was their secret weapon against the Klingon's) and they know Lorca subverted it by keying in false co-ordinates under extreme circumstances to jump to the mirror universe (something they more than happily classified). We also know it jumped 9 months forward in time coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

So something has to happen for the Federation to 100% lock it down and classify it as unsafe and unusable during TOS and TNG era.  Thats the end result from the show (it has to be) and to me, it would be sad to see those sort of possibilities be removed from the Trek universe.  

&amp;#x200B;

So..I think the solution is easy.  Throw Discovery and key supporting cast members (say...Mirror  Georgiou, Tyler and  [L'Rell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/characters/nm2371448?ref_=tt_cl_t12)  through time to a post Nemesis era.....say..20 years after and never EVER let them go back. Have it so the crew was assumed lost by the Federation + Klingon's  after their final Spore jump post TOS era with events that actually lead to the spore drive being classified and abandoned.  Maybe even have it so Picard is the one bringing them up to date. Eitherway, the crew can come back into the service of a newer Star Fleet / Klingon's whilst dealing with the loss of their family's. Maybe even have Worf bringing L'Rell up to date. The ship maybe gets a few minor overhall's (like a proper Holodeck) but is deemed sound enough to go back into exploratory service whilst Starfleet can re-open up the Spore drive for new shows.

&amp;#x200B;

If push really comes to shove, they can even use the Spore drive to resolve the Kelvin universe issue. Just needs some clever writing (since it seems unlikely to be resolved now).  

&amp;#x200B;

Eitherway...the Spore Drive is the problem and needs fixing without being abandoned imo.

&amp;#x200B;

259,"Of course, I wouldn't want the Klingon's to look like they do in Star Trek Discovery. I'd prefer they look like they did in DS9 &amp; TNG. I'd also prefer this show look similar to the style of TNG &amp; DS9.

They could delve deep into Klingon culture, the wars they went through, their traditions, rituals, strengths, weaknesses and all the bad ass things Klingons do.  Then of course, add tons of hot Klingon women with the cleavage and everything.  Battles, rough sex, war, that'd be awesome. Then we'd get to bear witness to the Klingon perspective when they deal with the federation and other cultures.  That'd be so interesting.

When Klingons receive a distress call from a planet from another race/culture that's in need, what would Klingons do?  Do they ever help those in need? If so, how? Do they coddle them or challenge them to make them stronger?

We know Neelix was given a set of temporary holo-lungs. We know that people eat/drink and possibly even choke on smoke. So we know the replication of holo products is almost perfect.

Now taking inspiration from that weird line in ""blink of an Eye"", imagine a future where, a Woman lost her husband before they had kids, and she had sex with a holo-representation of her husband.

Now obviously everything about him is a holorecreation, but! Say she conceived in the holodeck and stayed in there for most, if not all, of the term. Assuming she only ate food from outside the holoeck her body would create a child using both her own and a holo-representation of her husbands DNA.

Now this child, would only have 1/2 of a cells worth of DNA that was now Holographic. The rest would have been made by the mother based on the original, due to cellular Mitosis.

Now say the woman steps out of the Holodeck with her child, it might suffer very slight cell death in a few hundred cells. But a baby is still developing and can compensate for that (not to mention future medical tech)

So the result would be a 100% organic child, from a mother and a holo-father.

278,"So we know from the DS9 episode “Accession” that if a planet has a caste system of any kind, it is considered ineligible for membership to the federation. So what do you think happens to planets that meet all the technological and political requirements, but still discriminate against certain members of its population?




Let’s use the Vissians as an example. Their only appearance in the franchise was in the Enterprise episode “Cogenitor.” I’ve brought this episode up before, mainly because it infuriates me to no end (which might become apparent here.) I’m going to assume you’ve already seen the episode and are familiar with its contents. After watching it recently, I couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if the Vissians later applied for membership in the federation.




Imagine you’re a Vissian. Your civilization has practiced a form a sexual slavery for as long as your history records. It’s so accepted on your planet that no one ever questions it. One day, your planet’s government applies for membership into the Federation of Planets, the most powerful organization in the Alpha **and** Beta quadrants, with solid footholds in Delta and Gamma. Membership means security for your people, both on and off-world, a voice in galactic affairs, and access to the combined knowledge of thousands of unique civilizations.


Then it gets rejected.


And the reason why is made perfectly clear. The federation finds your treatment of the Cogenitors backwards and barbaric. Maybe they don’t say it like that, but they say it. So what does the average Vissian think now? Quintillion’s of people all looked at your society and said without hesitation “that’s backwards, barbaric, and wrong.” Does that give you pause?




The closest real life example of what I’m trying to describe would be apartheid. Most of the countries on earth utterly condemned what the South African government was doing to its black citizens. I’ve wondered before what it was like to be a supporter of apartheid at that time. The entire rest of the planet is telling you you’re the bad guy, how can you go on thinking that what you’re doing is right?



I’m sorry, this turned into another rant about an episode I’ve already ranted about multiple times. But at least this time, I’ve asked a question that I hope people on this this sub will find somewhat interesting.","I’m really sorry, but I have to rant about “Cogenitor” again..."
279,"I was rewatching TNG ""Darmok"" recently, where they mention that the Tamarians were first encountered by Starfleet about 100 years ago. It occurred to me that Discovery is right around that time period.

So, maybe Discovery could do an episode about First Contact with these guys?

But wait... that doesn't actually sound like fun. Nothing really exciting happened at the time, after all. They failed to crack the code of their language, nor was there any mention of a conflict. How would they give us an interesting episode without violating canon?

You make it the B plot, that's how. Put the focus of the episode on something else: crew relationships, recent events, some mundane problem that serves as a substrate for character development. First contact is one of those things that's seen as a big deal and they make whole episodes revolving around the clash of cultures and so on, but I find something amusingly appealing about doing a first contact episode where it's treated as just another day at the office. They spend a few hours trying to get to know these bizarre aliens who love their proper nouns so much, but eventually have to just give up before they say something offensive. Shaka, when the walls fell.

That would all be in the background. Most of the screen time would be about, I don't know, Burnham and Tilly debugging the translator and musing about the vagaries of life in space. I think it could really work as a breather episode. You know the kind I mean, like ""Captain's Holiday"" or ""In The Cards"". Something lighthearted to break up the more serious episodes.

I think it's a fun idea that I just wanted to share so everyone else can share in my disappointment when it never happens.",Tamarians in Discovery. Think it could work?

282,"As much as I love TOS, as much as I love TOS's unique aesthetic style that no other series has attempted to mimic (even when it really should), TOS just doesn't fit anymore.

Aesthetics aside, TOS has aged horribly on social issues. Yes, it was extremely progressive for its time *race wise* but its treatment of women was still rather appalling -- and note that TNG, DS9, even VOY and ENT also suffered from this in some respect. And to say that the Federation of TOS could even possibly be just 10 years after the significantly more progressive Federation of Discovery would be utterly insane.

Moving on from socio-political issues, TOS (and its sequel, TAS) also diverges from the rest of Trek canon significantly in many places. In ""Balance of Terror"" the Enterprise seems to fire phasers like torpedoes, and apparently requires a special ""Phaser Control"" room where crew members fire the weapons manually. Given that we see nothing like this in ENT, DIS, or anything that comes after TOS, this is a technical inconsistency. At another point, the Enterprise travels 1,000 lightyears at ordinary warp within just a few days -- Voyager could've gotten home much faster if that's how fast the *original* Enterprise could go. And there are many more that I could list but I want to avoid making a novel out of this.

Now, moving on to aesthetic issues. As much as I love the TOS aesthetic and think DIS should have respected it more, it should be noted that this aesthetic provides one of the biggest eyebrow-raising issues in all of TOS: Everything looks the same.
It would be one thing if the memorable TOS style was unique to Starfleet ships, but we see over the course of the series that Klingon ships, Romulan ships, ""Alien of the week"" ships, and even ancient human vessels like the Botany Bay all follow this aesthetic -- even though these are all vastly different cultures and situations behind construction, how do they look the same? That, along with the fact that many of the races we would later see in TNG and ENT appear in the stereotypical TOS makeup, even though later on the Klingons *and* Romulans would get their forehead ridges.
What this shows is that TOS doesn't really take itself seriously in many ways. We're supposed to suspect our disbelief that the aliens look like humans in light makeup and that all the interior scenes are made using recycled props and re-dressed sets and thus all look like they were built by the same race. And we're supposed to just ignore the countless glaring continuity errors, events that contradict later canon, and stories that should never have been written at all (Spock's Brain, anyone?). Within the larger scheme of the Star Trek cinematic universe, TOS is a trainwreck of errors that, though charming in its dated nature, and sentimentally valuable to fans, is doing more harm than good overall.

So here's what I suppose: CBS should declare the Original Series and its animated Spinoff to be in an alternate timeline of its own. Then they should reboot TOS as a modern show, they could pick out things to keep, and things to leave behind. Famous *good* episodes could be redone from the original script with only slight tweaks to fit better in canon, fix any politically ""sketchy"" material, and use the modern budget and effects to more closely achieve the original writer's original intentions for the episode (which they usually had to cut down), meaning we could have episodes like ""Balance of Terror"" ""City on the Edge of Forever"" ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""All our Yesterdays"" redone with stunningly beautiful sets and effects, and vastly more expansive scopes. Stories that could've been good or were good, but were written poorly, could be thus rewritten to achieve their true potential. As well as entirely new episodes to replace the ones that are completely irretrievable -- imagine replacing ""Turnabout Intruder"" with something awesome. And let's not forget that TAS, too, had some good episodes. Those episodes could be remade in stunningly beautiful live-action.

This sort of change wouldn't be for everyone, of course. There are a lot of TOS purists who would rather have *everything else* declared non-canon so TOS could shine on its own. But I think that, by placing TOS and TAS in their own alternate timeline, CBS could ensure that both original shows remain canon, but separately from the rest -- this, I hope, would satisfy both sides of the aisle.

There would, still, be some issues reconciling such a change with larger Trek canon. As shows like ""Relics"", ""Trials and Tribble-ations"", and ""In a Mirror Darkly"" all feature TOS heavily. But it is possible that modern VFX could edit each one to fit the rebooted show, and that the updated version could come out with, say, a 60th anniversary remaster -- note that this would mean TNG, DS9, and ENT would all be getting remastered.

On a final note, such a rebooted show need not start with Kirk. We could instead start with a remake of ""The Cage"" and go for a few seasons of Anson Mount's Pike before making the switch to Kirk -- this would, I imagine, cool the tempers of some fans by letting them get into the show while it was covering unexplored territory, which would make it easier for them to accept the eventually paving-over of TOS. Perhaps a seven-season run would be good -- two seasons for Pike's command, the episodes spread out over a long time span and another five for Kirk's famous Five Year Mission.

Anyway, what do you think? Should TOS be separated from Prime Canon? Would you watch such a reboot show? Do you think CBS would make a good show out of the reboot, Or would they fudge it terribly?

Edit: Well, the DIS hate here is rather astonishing. And the fact that, when faced with glaring inconsistencies in a story, everybody goes ""who cares, it's fictional"" is very disappointing to me as an amateur writer. If these people wrote TV shows, there would probably be no continuity at all.

Also, I must further remind you people that I'm talking about giving TOS it's own timeline to live in, separate from TNG. By doing this, you instantly resolve most of the inconsistencies in Trek canon without removing anything from canon. TOS remains canon, but in the same way that the Kelvin timeline is canon -- perhaps even with a point of divergence established. It also opens up the chance for us to relive some of the better moments of TOS with superior effects and improved production quality via the remake.","It's sad, but TOS needs to go in order for Trek canon to fit more smoothly."
283,,Star Trek showerthought: John Torres must have been a huge SM freak
284,"Let me pose a hypothetical question. 

Can Data be cloned?

Let's say I were to take the basic Star Trek transporter technology and combine it with their replicator technology to create a machine that can clone any object. Put an item in the transporter and it gets transported from one pad to another. The object is turned into a massive amount of data in the pattern buffer. That data is sent to the other pad where the transporter rematerialized the item. 

At the same time, what if that same information in the pattern buffer was sent to a replicator? The replicator uses the information to create that same object. And there you go, you have an original sitting on the transporter pad and a replica sitting in the replicator.

Now who knows if you could use such a theoretical machine on a person. Whatever comes out of the replicator might be a living breathing person...or it could be a lifeless pile of organic tissue. That's a discussion for another time, but what about Data? 

He's a machine. So whatever comes out of the replicator, would be an exact clone. Either it could be an exact duplicate with all of data's memories in tact, or it would be a technical replica only. A completely clean, brand new positronic brain that is ready to either be dissected so they could figure out how it works, or ready to be programmed with a new personality. ""An android on every ship"" as they wanted in the episode where Data was declared a sentient being.

We've decided to run a little experiment.

So we will be trying out having an ""off topic"" post, pinned to the top of the sub for a day or so every week, where users can gather, have a tall glass of prune juice or Romulan Ale, and talk about how things are going and what you're doing/looking forward to/cooking/playing/watching.

TNG has terrible first and second seasons. Yes, there are a few gems, but fifty-two, hour-long episodes is a slog to get through for only a handful of decent ones. Season three to seven, however, are my personal favourite Trek.

DS9 also starts slow yet the first and second seasons are actually watchable. Season three to seven are also amazing Trek and arguably tied with TNG for the best. Duet is my favourite Trek episode of all time.

VOY is fine with some gems. It’s standout seasons are four and five, but the others are still good and perfectly watchable. My favourite part of VOY is Elite Force.

ENT is half and half. The first two seasons are fine with some gems and the final two seasons are great. Just be sure to stop watching at the second to last episode. Terra Prime is a much better finale than These are the Voyages

Wouldn’t it be much wiser if they just don’t holster their phasers in the first place when beaming away? Of course, this would only apply in certain situations that call for it. That’s one less step for them to take and it’s much safer security-wise.

This is a chance to do something weird like, as I've seen many suggest, a transporter accident that ages him into William Shatner, or a body swap into another Trek alum like Jeffrey Combs... or why not Jeri Ryan? She's already proven to be fantastic at that as we saw from the time the Doctor was uploaded into Seven of Nine. I have no problem seeing a known Trek actor take on another role, hell, Combs did that plenty of times. It could be really fun seeing Kirk, a known womanizer, having to deal with the looks and attention he gets from the crew, dealing with the issues that women have to contend with, like men not wanting to take orders from her, or encountering a male dominated sexist society that they have to work with to achieve a goal. Maybe he suddenly finds the skirts the women wear objectifying (I'm sure he would feel very uncomfortable in one of those) and changes the uniforms. Yes, they already did a male/female swap with Kirk in Turnabout Intruder, but that was awful. You can still get the Kirk charisma and rapport with the crew with a different actor. They could get a great, modern sci-fi writer like NK Jemisin to write the screenplay.

I hope they abandon the 'Kirk meets his Dad' story anyway, that sounds like a terrible idea. Just go back to the drawing board and create something new and in the spirit of Star Trek: smart, thought-provoking science fiction. ",I wish they would make Star Trek 4 without Chris Pine
312,"Molly O'Brian was born during an Enterprise crippling disaster, Naomi Wildman during a near-destruction Voyager event, even the birth of Kirk during the film Star Trek (2009) saw the destruction of the USS Kelvin. What a strange coincidence.","Is it me, or do pregnancies and disaster go hand in hand in Star Trek?"
313,"I really wanted to like this show but in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, I was very disappointed and even angry at it. It does, however carry name Star Trek and so I gave it several chances and midway through the season I found it to be tolerable, even likable. Did it ever “feel” like Star Trek to me? No, but I thought perhaps it could in time.

And then I watched the last few episodes. My God what a mess. Twists for shock value, for the sake of having twists. It felt like the show had no idea where it was going with it. I was woefully disappointed like I had been during the first episode.

The sad thing is the show has AMAZING characters. Saru, Tilly, Lorca were all well-developed and well acted. Seriously stellar performances from those actors. We could have further explored their motivations and personalities. Instead we got shitty plot twists that make no sense.

And then what they did with Lorca...so immensely disappointing. He was complex, driven, gritty. A wartime Starfleet captain whose ends justify the means. A Star Trek antihero.

And they took that idea and shattered it with a dumb plot twist.

To me Star Trek has always been exploring the human condition with a view towards the future seen in a positive light. Maybe that’s just me favoring TNG but that’s what it’s always been for me. This show was nothing like that. It felt empty and soulless. In these crazy times I think we need a little less dystopia and a lot more TNG. A lot more Picard.

And yet it makes me really nervous about the new Picard show. ",I’m sorry but I found Star Trek: Discovery horrible
314,"I'm a long time Star Trek fan, but I should note that this mainly included TOS and TNG. I grew up watching TOS reruns and the films as a kid and watched all of TNG from start to finish during its initial run. I watched the first season and part of the second of DS9, but lost interest in it a bit, and due to life changes (graduating from high school, joining the military, getting married, etc.) I just never got back into watching Star Trek while any series were still around.

Fast forward a couple of decades, and about two years ago I decided to start watching DS9, as I finally had the time and the means to do so (thanks Netflix!). Although I took a long break from it in the middle of the series, I just now finished watching it in its entirety. Oh boy, what I missed from back in the day. DS9 most certainly belongs in the pantheon of great Star Trek series.

However, this has all left me with a bit of a conundrum. I haven't seen much of Voyager or Enterprise beyond a handful of episodes of each. Although I've seen no episodes of Voyager that I've liked (beyond the pilot), Enterprise held my attention the little that I've been able to see of it. Of course, knowing how Star Trek series tend to go, you can't judge a whole series by just a couple of episodes.

So, this all leads me to my question. Which series should I watch next, Voyager or Enterprise? From my understanding, Voyager is the weakest of the Star Trek series, whereas Enterprise is the shortest, with the exception being TOS. Which series do you guys think will disappoint me the least, especially after just watching DS9?",Which series to watch next?
315,"Minor spoilers for DS9? I don’t know. Here’s my script.

Sisko is going hyper-minigolfing with Jake and Kasidy. Dukat decides the Pah-Wraiths want him to ruin Sisko’s day. 

He disguises himself as Kai Winn to get close to Sisko and stab him. But all the Bajorans are crowding him at the minigolf, because they think he’s kai winn. Sisko notices a ruckus in the background but thinks nothing of it. Dukat is stymied and yells his new catchphrase “those accursed Bajorans!”.  No one thinks it’s weird, because that’s very normal behavior for Kai Winn. (Dukat remains in the Kai’s clothes the whole episode, but from this point on they get dirtier and more torn each time we see him.)

Dukat goes to get some Bajoran crocogators from the water area of the golf course. He sneakily sprays some crocogator bait on Sisko’s golf club. But Dukat’s holding the bottle backwards! He gets covered in the spray, and the gators attack him. He repeats his catchphrase. 

It’s the 18th hole, a windmill. Dukat is hiding on the other side of the windmill, so he can replace Sisko’s ball with an exploding one. Right as the ball comes through the windmill, the spinny part catches his underwear. He is lifted into the air with a gigantic wedgie. Sisko gets a hole in one. “Those accursed Bajoran’s!”

The minigolf owners take the Emissary’s hole in one as a sign from the Prophets. They arrange a big feast. Dukat gets a cold fusion drilling machine. He’s going to undermine the foundations of the Feast Hall and kill everyone inside. 

He takes a wrong turn and gets out of the drill to investigate. He’s in the maintenance shed! One of the workers left a bunch of rakes lying around. Dukat stumbles from one to the other, getting hit in the face by each one. 

‘Those accursed Baj-‘, but just then, the drill machine that Dukat left running causes the shed to collapse on him. 

Cut to Quark’s. Jake and Sisko are telling the gang about the great time they had. Worf mentions that a maintenance shed was sabotaged; Starfleet Intelligence suspects the Dominion. Odo says if that’s the best they can do, they aren’t up to par. Everyone laughs. 

We see Dukat in a Bajoran hospital. He’s in a full body cast with a hot water bag on his head and a thermometer in his mouth. Muffled by the cast and the thermometer, he wearily mumbles “those accursed Bajorans...”",Dukat’s Big Day
316,"I just discovered this on Youtube, would never really consider myself one to watch fan films (besides Axanar, which I love), but Star Trek Continues is amazing.

Okay, sure, I've seen some complain about the acting but come on.

324,"I've always kind of ignored Enterprise. Recently I decided I'd give it another go (couldn't be worse than DISCO).

I started with the first season and I liked some episodes in there. For some reason Terra Nova has the most detailed showing of an alien species in any Star Trek episode, or am I crazy? Haven't seen that often that we see such a detailed culture in a one-episode species (although they weren't even aliens). A lot of Enterprise plots seem to revolve about Archer getting captured though. Then Reed wants to shoot up the place, but they decide for another plan. Other plots revolve around T'Pol looking extremely pissed off (the episode with the rape-hippie-Vulcans being the climax).

Enterprise got kind of formulaic, so I skipped a lot of season 2.
Season 3 was amazing though. They got that really right with the constant threat of the Expanse, being pretty much isolated from other ships and the main arc was pretty solid. I liked the mystery of the spheres. The characters finally got to shine and many got through an evolution. Watching DISCO before this, I think they tried to achieve something similar with DISCO S1 (but failed IMO). 

Enterprise managed to have a great main arc and great single episodes. DISCO didn't achieve both. 

But now for the bad things in ENT S3:

- Too much time travel. We have single plots about time travel, the main arc is heavily time travel influenced and I think that's just a bad writing element. Archer heard of the Federation before founding it, so who really invented it? At least we get T'Pol in a driveway tho

- The finale was amazing imo. The crew is at the end of their powers and want to return home. But no: THEY TIME TRAVELED

- Ultimately this could have played after Voyager or whenever. The crew has some minor problems because it's so early in Star travel but this doesn't make too much of a difference. Vortexes get introduced and this seems like post-warp-technology... We also get a planet-destroying weapon... So lots of advanced technology.

Go to one area of the ship and your back before the caretaker, go to a different area and your during Seska’s siege of the ship. Well at the end when they get all of the pieces put back together, how is it that Chakotay is the only one with full recollection of the event? All of them had the same antidote as he so that they could cross time frames. The only explanation is that because they merged back as one in the time he’s from that some how that makes him special. However the plan totally depended on him having intact memory of the event to configure the deflector dish when he returns so that the temporal accident never occurs. How did they know for sure that he would remember? There’s no way of knowing that. Also how did they know for sure that he’d be dumped off before the accident occurred? I might just assume that it would dump him back off at the moment it happened.

Also one final question, why would telling Janeway about what happened go against the temporal prime directive? The event was wiped from continuity so he wouldn’t be spoiling anything by telling her.

But I suspect that the first Omega explosion also caused the Mycelial network to collapse/die. Since the Omega molecule damages subspace, and the Mycelial network exists in subspace, it wouldn't be that far fetched to assume that the first Omega explosion on the Starfleet research station caused a subspace chain reaction that spread through the Mycelial network neutralizing it.

355,"First, let me say that as a lifelong fan, I actually really dig the Starfleet we see in Discovery. It's gritty and sharp. But it doesn't mesh well with the Constitution-style ships that defined the TOS era. Why the difference?

I think there's an assumption in Trek fandom that ships evolve with technology. The Galaxy-class is so much bigger than the Constitution because we eventually figured out how to make a ship that big. The saucers are swept because it was somehow more useful than the blockier versions of the past.

I don't think this is necessarily the case. 

Three things affect starship design: Technology, Requirement, and Stylistic Choice.

**Tech**

Yes, tech advancement certainly comes into play. Mostly with the engines, I'd assume. But this wouldn't explain why things get bigger. As tech advances, it usually gets smaller. The difference between the size of the Sovereign nacelle and an Intrepid nacelle are huge, and yet their top speeds are pretty comparable. A Nova class is tiny, but still goes pretty fast. The engines have to be sufficient to deal with the size of the ship.

The STO explanation for why the Sovereign and Vesta are so narrow is because the slipstream tunnel they can utilize takes much less energy to sustain if it's got a smaller diameter, but tech advancements really take a back seat to the requirements for the ship.

**Requirement**

Constitutions are smaller than a Crossfield (which I suspect is an advanced refit of a much older ship), because they should be. They're battle-cruisers designed to take on a D7. They're no frills. They need to be quick and sustainable. Galaxies are huge because they're deep space explorers designed to house a small city of families. It's a peacetime ship. When a wartime ship is needed, the Sovereign offers a smaller, more compact target, fewer weak points, like the vulnerable neck, etc, and yet is large enough to transport armies, escort convoys, stand in line of battle, and handle the firepower it's got without shaking itself apart.

When we watch Discovery, what are we looking at? We're looking at a Starfleet that's about 100 years old, and has been more or less at peace throughout that time. Ask any grunt what the peacetime quality of their equipment is, and it sucks. Remember in the Iraq war when stories came out of soldiers strapping hunks of metal to their transports as extra armor because they didn't have modern available armor. Rumsfeld said ""You go to war with the army you have,"" and he was right. Peacetime forces generally run on old equipment and tech. These ships are old. They're explorer craft. They're not designed for war. And in Disco they're getting destroyed at a fast clip. Meanwhile they're building Connies, a war ship. Mirandas, a war ship. Someone's drawing early designs for the Excelsior on a cocktail napkin right about now. I'm betting these will be phased out, and we'll see newer, more recognizable ships phase in.

**Style**

Humans are artistic, probably more than we're practical. When we see these ships, we're looking at stylistic zeitgeists of the time. The Disco ships are art deco. Bronze coloring, straight, overlapping lines, engines in sharp points. Do they NEED to be like that? Probably not. But somewhere on Earth is a head designer of San Francisco Fleetyards who's signature style was art deco starships. And some young buck whose sensibilities steer toward Atomic Era design is coming in. ""Hey, why not round nacelles and military gray?""  


Style doesn't evolve, it just changes. Brutalist architecture is hundreds of years more advanced than Gothic architecture but one is hardly the evolved form of the other. Starfleet had an Art Deco era, and Atomic Era, a Militaristic Era, an Organic Era, etc. And they'll change again.",My take on Discovery Era ships

I was thinking about Commander Data, and how even though he is a fantastic technical design that was basically one of a kind (besides Lore and B4 if you have to count him).  He was the culmination of a scientists dream who wanted to make a being who would learn and better himself through experience as Data had even though Soong knew himself that he (Soong) was flawed.  

Then I remembered the TOS episode I Mudd.  The android Norman I think seemed even more complex.  He had desires and ambitions, and the idea that he and his android race were needed to “take care of humans” by serving them.  Norman was of course defeated by Kirk and Company.

Two very different androids to say the least.

The thing I just thought about though is that there were no references to the remaining androids.  What do you think happened to them.  Kirk mentioned that they reverted back to their original programming of geological work and they were tasked to also keep Harry Mudd out of space (with a bunch of X wife androids).

363,"If there’s one thing Star Trek fans love to do, it’s speculate. How does this thingababob work?  How does a species have a language based on stories, with no way to explain what individual words mean?  How functional is Data?

So it stands to reason that speculation hits a fever pitch when they announce a new show with the return of Picard. People have been dying for a return to the post-TNG era, and we’re finally going to get it. 

But some seem to think this will be something of a sequel to the old shows:

“Picard is living with Vash on an empty planet, working at an archaeological site. Captain Nog shows up with his holographic first Officer, Vic Fontaine. They join Geordi and Seven of Nine on an adventure with the Traveler to rescue Sisko from the wormhole. The only thing that stands in their way is a team of Dukat, Species 8472, and Sela. Garak arrives on the Titan, but can he be trusted?  Only HoloData as the ship’s computer can say for sure!”

I think the ties to past shows will only happen in passing. CBS isn’t going to launch a new show that’s dependent on someone having seen 700+ episodes of older shows. 

I imagine there will be little Easter eggs and cameos here and there to make us happy, but they’re not going to make past events pivotal pieces of the plot. They’ll want this new show to be open for new viewers — people who only have a passing knowledge of TNG and the other shows — and they’re certainly not going to want to bog it down with lengthy scenes of exposition where they explain storylines from 30 years ago. 

Personally, I’ll just be happy to see Picard back on the screen. As long as he rips into someone with a speech about ethics and morals, I’ll count it as a success. ",Why the new Picard show will not involve a mission to save Sisko

Since we both admit it’s our weakest show from a knowledge standpoint, we want to hit at least 5 good ones. Yes, we could search the google and get some recos, but there is no better collection of Trek curators out there willing to share THEIR opinion than this. here. SUB. 

Top 5 and if there is any particular order, throw that in too.

370,"Feeling inspired by the recent Troi's thread, I'd like to share my own idea about an issue in Voyager existing since the original run of the show. 
When I first watched the series I was little more than a kid and had almonst an obsession with the Borg. 
When Seven joined I was ecstatic (a Borg character who isn't a villain *and* is an attractive woman? 10/10 for my brain). 

Soon though it bothered me to no end that she didn't wear a uniform. At first it was because I simply like uniforms and having Seven wearing one would feel like she was truly part of the crew and later, growing up, also because I felt Seven would have tried to mix with the Voyager crew to feel once again in a group of identical individuals. 

I disliked the fact that the Maquis started wearing uniforms, a symbol of what they were fighting, while the lone ex-Borg striving for a collective would wear a pretty unique and revealing one piece. 

I would have loved Seven wearing a uniform, exploring the ideas that wearing the same outfit of your colleagues brings and her bonding with the crew. 

The fanservice aspect could have been kept in particular scenes, there would be quite a few ways to insert some eye candy moments without having Jeri Ryan wear a skintight for the whole series (I'm not against fanservice per se, but I prefer it to be the exception in a show and to be used only when the context is sound. Also fanservice with men isn't a bad idea).

I was rewatching *The Drumhead* the other night.  It gives me chills how eerily prescient the episode was, and depressingly so given that it used our past as inspiration.   But there is a tidbit that is often overlooked.  A morsel that is hidden behind the feast of Picard’s speech and Admiral Satie.   


J’Dan.  A rarity in TNG era Klingons.  First, a scientist.  The is sadly a job that is way underrepresented in our dealing with Klingons.  After all, they do have to have brilliant minds to design and maintain their amazing ships. 


He does not dress in the typical Klingon fashion, perhaps due to his extended exchange with the Federation.  Kurn still wore his uniform, but perhaps J’Dan was never a member of the KDF.   Still, a Klingon in civilian clothes and wearing a *Federation* combadge is an unusual sight. 


Third, he is a spy.  He appear to be working with the Romulans, but also has (or claims) high connections in Klingon society.  (I am glad they didn’t explicitly link him to the Duras family). Klingon Intelligence is mentioned and seen on DS9, and TOS has a couple examples of Klingon spies. But TNG didn’t as much. 


He has one very key line that made me think of his place in the overarching Klingon story:


J'DAN: The blood of all Klingons has become water. Since the Federation alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies. Romulans are strong. They are worthy allies. They do not turn Klingons into weaklings like you. 



It is almost as if he believes that the Federation will corrupt, has corrupted the Empire, yet with the Romulans they will “Remain Klingon”.  



T’Kuvma’s belief was nothing new in DSC, but perhaps just the earliest chronological appearance.  


T’Kuvma. Chang. J’Dan. All trying in their own way to recapture glory days that perhaps never were...


(And ultimately, failing since we know the Klingon empire officially joins the Federation by Daniel’s time in ENT).

We’ve got this big bad alien, almost tidal, force called The Borg, slowly expanding across the galaxy, and they’ve just become aware of humanity and The Federation.  Their mix of organic tissue and fast replicating technology fuels their slow, unstoppable, terrifying drive to assimilate all known life into their collective.  They are perfectly set up to be “The Boogeyman” instilling foreboding and dread into space explorers and viewers alike.

And given Picard made them aware of the future events, they could well be in a successful marriage too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not that I'd want the new series to feel it has to be tied down to too much backstory for fear of it alienating new viewers, I just thought it'd be an interesting change to see Picard at a different phase of his life demonstrating a new confidence in that area.

400,"I did a rewatch of TOS while listening to the Mission Log podcast, then decided it was time to keep going and take the plunge on TAS. I'd never felt a burning need to watch it, but at the same time - it's Star Trek, and it's new to me!

I can see both why it's worth watching and why so many people skip it.

The good: The plots are very Star Trek-y, but without the bloat that made some episodes feel like they took forever to get anywhere. ""Yesteryear"" fills in a lot of Spock's backstory, and ""More Tribbles, More Trouble"" is basically ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" without the INTERMINABLE bar fight. Even the episodes that are just okay have both a lot to chew on philosophically and entertainment value.

The bad: The animation is really dated and cheap looking. There's no way around it, and you just have to accept it if you're going to watch. The voice work is also really stiff, as if nobody is talking to anyone else - likely because the cast was rarely together to record. There are also weird continuity errors and a tendency to make up technobabble to fill in gaps in the stories.

Overall, it's worth watching, as long as you know what you're getting in to. Plus at just 22 episodes, it's not much of a time commitment. ",Been a Trek fan for 30 years - and I'm finally watching The Animated Series
401,"Inspired by the recent thread about Garrett's desire for a Voyager movie, here's my idea of how they could have managed it, or perhaps even still could.

Start by deriving some urgent crisis in the Delta quadrant which Starfleet has to respond to.  And logically, what team has the most experience with that region of space and the McGuffin in question? The Voyagers!

This would make for a great addition to the story without having to alter the show.

The first part of the movie could briefly show what everyone had been up to since their return in the short scenes in which Janeway has to ""get the band back together.""  

And add the risk that they may get stuck in the Delta quadrant again; we've managed to jerry-rig some device that can get them there, but it only works from our end so the return plan is dubious and dependent on success.

Janeway is resigned to go, although she has a lot of sighing and eye rolling going along with it.

She recruits Tuvok and Barclay first; they don't hesitate to sign on.  Seven agrees, but not without protest; perhaps there is a specific threat to her.

But no one else is so easy.  Tom and B'Elanna have a family; can they leave their kids? Do they bring them along?  Each agrees that surely they can be replaced, but Janeway always gets her way.  Also, Tom has lost a lot of hair. 

Chakotay agrees, but only because he wants to support Janeway and Seven. Perhaps he protests, but when Seven agrees he acquiesces.
Hacoochimoya. 

Or hell, maybe Seven is lost and in danger in the Delta and that's the inciting action in the first place.

Maybe bringing the Doctor along is only possible if he is resigned to sick bay once again, for some reason they can't take his emitter.  He doesn't like this idea, but he owes everything to his family.  He's a doctor, not a commando.

Kim flat out refuses.  He has a completely perfect life in every way.  It looks like the trip will go without him--until a last minute change of heart has him walk on to the bridge just before departure where he takes a new post since he's a Lt. now.

Maybe they could even run into Neelix upon arrival or find that Kes is involved in the threat. 

Anyway, that's how the movie is setup.  Hell, they could still do it all these years later.

The first 20 minutes could be basically a comedy as Janeway rallies her reluctant crew.

Then they go- and chaos and disaster immediately upon arrival for the next hour when they finally save the day and somehow get home again.  During all of this, the dynamics are different now-the crew is fighting amongst themselves, they all blame each other for various problems and especially Janeway for getting them back into this mess! 

Upon returning home, the crew has patched up their differences and even feel nostalgic for the old days.  Maybe they'll stick together for a while.  Maybe one more adventure...

Voyager 2: The Wrath of Kes

Voyager 3: The Search for Tuvok.

Voyager 4: The Voyage Home...again, but first time traveling and getting whales

Voyager 5:  Janeway beats up God, in the Delta Quadrant 

Voyager 6: The Final Peace accords with..the Borg!? 

I think that CBS recently got the message loud and clear that people want more Trek.  And by year's end they'll merge with Paramount as a ploy to have a more valuable company to eventually get bought by Disney.  So it's not too late!!!

In The Year of Hell, Janeway tells Chakotay to recycle the pocket watch he replicated for her birthday because it represented a pair of boots, a hypo, or a meal. So with that in mind, why couldn't Voyager just collect some inedible plants or rocks from a planet, recycle them into the replicator and use that energy to create something they needed, instead of giving out replicator rations due to energy conservation? Could they only recycle things that were originally replicated? ","question about replicators, specifically in Voyager"

Now, I've always been heavily interested with Science Fiction movies, novels and tv shows. And Star Trek is one of those that I've always had my eyes on but never really went with watching them or read any of the novels. Instead of googling random articles or wiki's. I've sort of decided to take it to Reddit and what better alternative is to ask the subreddit itself.

I've seen a maybe one or two Star Trek movies, in the past few years, maybe 2011 iirc but remember that one vaguely. But recently watched Beyond, and I loved it. Though kinda didn't get some things like Ambassador Spock and younger Spock, also watched Discovery, actually binged it and I loved that one.

I'd like to get into the TV show side of things. Like where to start, whats the best TV series by popular opinion or smth like that, I've always been so conflicted on where to begin and if I should follow chronological order, same goes for movies and maybe books/novels.

422,"roll it back, basically I've been making an effort to watch all the core star Trek series. my first stop off was TNG as it was the one I was most interested in and I've got the box sets of TOS and Enterprise to get to later.

But right now I'm working through voyager and my thoughts;

\-I agree with most that it's certainly one of the weaker series, I think SF debris called it TNG in a new coat of paint and I'm inclined to agree. Though I'd say there are far more enjoyable episodes after season 3.

\-Surprisingly I seem to be at odds with many people about Kes, the show greatly improved with her leaving. Her actress gave a very soft breathy performance and with her telepathic power she was just another Troi only even less important. Her species as well is one of the worst designed for a main character. The only problem with her leaving was that they never seemed to think about replacing her with another nurse, not even a non-speaking one.

\-I think this one is really gonna get me some hate, but I'm actually enjoying Neelix. At least beyond season 3, and even then you can see any Arc there from a bumbling conman with a childish temperament to an actually helpful character.

\-While overdone sometimes, Tuvok is not a bad vulcan, I've seen worse ones in TNG (and I've heard I'll run into many more bad ones in enterprise)

\-I do agree with many of the community that the Doctor and Seven are some of the highlights of the entire show. Though halfway through season 5 I'm already getting repeated stories for seven. And it is a bit annoying when you have you tell people the large titted woman in a tight uniform is one of the better characters and have to wait and see how they take that.

\-The magical repairing ship and the near limitless supply of shuttlecraft is probably one of the biggest weaknesses once you notice it, because once you do, it just can't be ignored.

\-Kazon? bad copy of a klingon

Viddian? Nice idea, almost like an organic version of the borg. But needed more than 3 episodes.

Those hunter aliens-forgot their names because they're less ""predator"" and more ""elmer fudd""

The Garbage scout aliens-a nice idea again, but buried with too few epsiodes and not enough interesting details.

Those are just a few of my thoughts. Will you tell me I'm doomed from this point on (again about mid season 5), or give me hope for that emmy award winning seventh season episode I've never heard of? ",So I got to Voyager

So basically, I was a huge Star Wars fan, and I was interested in Star Trek because I wanted to see what it was all about. Therefore, I checked out TOS and by now have watched all the episodes of TOS including The Cage and all the TOS crew movies, except for TMP since my library doesn't have it as of now. 

I watched some TNG, mostly skipping around, and some DS9 as well, but only a couple episodes. I wanted to watch TNG right now, is there any definitive list?

MONTHS went by before i finally found out it seems to not be aired on ANY cable network but is rather online only, who the fuck thought this was a good idea?

so after pirating the show as ill be damned if im going to pay for a show that is on a network i PAY over 200.00 a month to have on xfinity... i am trying to get used to a few things, not bad so far but i would say the show panders too much for my taste. i do not enjoy any show/movie that feels the need to talk its way though every aspect of what is hapening on the screen and it seems thus far anyway, that startrek does this. im only 2 episodes in however so im holding off on final judgments.

however the real reason i came on here was to ask a question, a question about previews. at the end of the 2nd episode there is a 6 minute section that is only marked as separate from the episode in a passing remark about 'still to come in startrek' and then it goes into a reveal of all the fucking plot points in the season? am i just weird or do others despise this type of shit too? I feel angry when someone spoils an ending or give away a plot point and yet all over the movies and tv there seems to be this trend to showing all of the best parts, spoiling all the reveals, and just deflating all the air out of the scripts before they are released?

just a rant from what ive noticed so far

tl;dr  fuck previews

i also do not understand the story arc that some how michael started all this... she is blamed by her captian, starfleet, and the people on the transport she is on in ep3. so she goes to investigate an artifact, while there gets attacked by a klingon and wins, then she tries to attack them but is not allowed to. from how i see it she is only guilty of staying alive. its starfleets policy to not shoot first that is what allowed the war to proceed and it is the klingons fault there is war.  now at the end she goes to the klingon ship to capture the fucking guy and then kills him? i dont get that, seems lazy writing to me. in either case its her fault he may be a maryter now but the war was already started by that point.

I can't seem to glean a consistent pattern of usage from the episodes in which dress uniforms are worn. In the wedding scenes, its wear ranges from no one (TOS's ""Balance of Terror"") to only those officiating or part of ""wedding party"" in dress uniform (TNG's ""Data's Day"" and VOY's ""Course: Oblivion"") to all Starfleet personnel in attendance (""Nemesis""). Other scenes are equally mystifying, as it doesn't seem to ever be worn by everyone at a given occasion.

It's also canonical that humans are kind of seen as the leaders of the federation. We often see other races mention Humans first and foremost when talking about the federation.

488,"With the recent paycut debacle involving Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth, the future of the Kelvin Timeline films is in jeopardy. Now I know a ton of Trek fans hate those films, but I'm one of the few Trek fans who seem to really like them. They recaptured elements of TOS but mixed in with big screen action. They weren't perfect, but I've enjoyed them and I don't think the Kelvin francise deserves to die. So I have thought of a way to save it (possibly). So here's my idea:

Focus on a new starship and crew. I mean, come on, Kirk and the Enterprise crew can't be the only ones who have had amazing adventures. A new captain and crew on a different ship set at the same time as Chris Pine's Kirk adventures could be a smart move and a chance to start fresh. Maybe Pine or Quinto could be persuaded to appear in a cameo at the beginning or something.

They don't need to follow the adventures of The Enterprise. Look at what they did with Discovery, different ship, different captain, different crew. The Kelvin Timeline needs to learn from Discovery and follow suit.

I would follow the adventures of Matt Decker in the Kelvin Timeline, and I'd cast Mark Ruffalo or Henry Rollins as I feel both those guys would bring something interesting to the role. My idea is that in the Kelvin Timeline, Decker and his crew never encounter the doomsday machine (or it plays out totally different and Decker doesn't lose his crew and go insane) and they continue to have many more adventures on the USS Constellation.

It could also be set around or a little before the events of Star Trek 2009, maybe Bruce Greenwood could reprise his version of Pike briefly. Maybe get JJ Abrams to return in the director's chair, and maybe hire some better writers who can come up with a new Trek script that'll really grab audiences. I think this could be the shot in the arm that the Kelvin films need.",A possibly way to save the Kelvin Timeline movies

493,"Preface: Dad was a big Trek fan when I was growing up. I was old enough (8 years old) to remember watching the TNG series finale with him. I watched some DS9 then too but overall I wasn't a fan of Trek because I was a child and couldn't understand the storylines. I watched Voyager with him regularly as a teenager. So I watched the Abrams Star Trek movies and got nostalgic for the times I bonded with my dad watching Trek and wanted to take the voyage myself. Found I loved Trek. Watched TOS, then TNG, then DS9. 

It took me a year or so to get through DS9. I liked almost every episode (only ep I truly hate was the one where they're stuck inside the game on season 1), I liked every character. I can't believe how much its series finale is impacting me. Yesterday I hummed the shows theme song at work all day. Just thinking about the ending makes me cry. I can't believe it's over. I can't believe the characters are gone and I'll never be caught up in their lives anymore.

I have a few problems with the finale. Namely, I feel that Damar deserved to live. He should have lived and gave a broadcast to both Cardassia and Bajor to finally build a bridge between their two worlds. To officially seal the end of the old Cardassia (literally) and the birth of a new one. But they killed him and no speech was had. Just Cardassia and its ashes. It's utterly depressing and it amazes me how given how much the show harped on the relationship between the two planets, they neglected to take advantage of showing a bridge between the two nations, in earnest, at last. It's a baffling creative decision and leaves me wanting. Instead, they decided to make a scene at Vic's. 

Besides that, and the fact that Ezri and Julian feels tacked on and forced, I thought the ending was about as good as it could get. 

Right now I'm mourning that I'll never see the characters I love again. Kira, with her strong headed badassery, and her soft spirituality. She may very well be my favorite Star Trek character but I'm still deciding. The woman who was able to let go of her hate for Caradassians and work to help free them. The ending shot of her and Jake looking longingly for Sisko's return broke my heart, but what made me most emotional was Worf. Worf was always my favorite Star Trek character even as far back as when I was a kid. Besides Kira, no other character resonates with me as much as him and he really shined in DS9. So the final shot of him leaving the station looking at the promenade made me cry so hard because I knew it'd be the last time I'd ever seen Worf in Trek and I was forced to say goodbye to someone I've known since I was a child.

I can't believe I'm mourning someone that isn't even real. 

I can't believe it's over. Someone hold me.",Yesterday I finished DS9 after watching for a year. Please mourn with me.

499,"Not sure if this is the right forum to discuss this, but is anyone else underwhelmed or even disappointed with the quality of Eaglemoss’s offerings? 

My first purchase was Defiant, and while it wasn’t as accurate as I could hope it was decent for a $22 toy. I picked up a Steamrunner that was okay, but the nacelles have embedded blue plastic rather than the fully enclosed nacelles I saw in First Contact. 

I gave it one last shot with the Sovereign, especially since so many people online have raved about it. What a letdown. It appears to be the First Contact variant with its extremely light colored finish, but the detailing is absolute rubbish, and some details that should be visible just aren’t there. 

I looked at the XL line but reviews and pictures made me change my mind. The XL Defiant has inaccurate nacelles, the XL Sovereign either has misaligned painted details or just blank hull, and the XL Galaxy looks rubbish to me. 

I think Eaglemoss’s level of detail is okay for very small ships like Defiant and probably the shuttles, but they lack the definition to replicate the bigger ships with any clarity. Out of three purchases, I’m 70% satisfied with one and dissatisfied with the others. 

I would venture though that TOS ships, with their lack of detailing and simpler shapes, would turn out better than TNG/DS9/VOY/Movie ships. ",Underwhelmed by Eaglemoss

504,"I've been thinking about running a Star Trek RPG soon, and about the Treaty of Algeron (forbidding the Federation from developing cloak technology), and about the premise of a continuous narrative chain through The Wrath Of Khan, The Search For Spock, The Voyage Home, and The Undiscovered Country (skipping ST5 entirely).

My best recollection is as follows: in TSFs, Kruge was aware of preliminary diplomatic talks between the Klingon and Federation governments, well before the Praxis disaster. And similarly, in TUC, the Romulan Ambassador was present at the Khitomer conference for reasons not made clear in the film itself. 

My understanding is that, since everything else in TSFS flows directly from the aftermath of the Genesis debacle, it follows that the diplomatic efforts Kruge referenced do as well. The Genesis device soon proved to be an utter failure as a terraforming system, but its applicability as a planet-killing weapon was instantly obvious to everyone involved. 

So my conclusion is that the Treaty of Algeron isnt so much that the Romulans can have cloaking technology but the Federation can't; rather that nobody can be allowed to have both the capacity to create a Genesis device and the capacity to deploy it under cloak to an enemy world. Each of the political powers on the galactic stage can have one or the other, but if anybody tries to have both, then everyone else unites to obliterate them. 

Seen in this not-necessarily-canon light, the Romulan Commander Taris in TNG: Contagion, insisting that the Federation could not be allowed to gain control of Iconian Gateway technology... starts to look a lot less villainously nationalistic.

So I saw the first two episodes. Farpoint was good, if a bit quirky and slow-paced.

But, S1E2, The Naked Now, has really put me off.

I'll forgive the one-dimensional 'everyone gets drunk and now almost everyone just wants to screw each other.' Only a handful actually do *other* drunk things. It's dumb but fine. Must be a lot of tension being stuck on a ship forever, even if it was shown in the pilot the enterprise is actually pretty big. Maybe Starfleet don't allow crew to have formal relationships?

I had also expected Wesley to be a problem, it's a bit of a meme. But this trope of 'bumbling idiot endangers the cast and gets rewarded' really gets to me.

Wesley, a child civilian, starts a mutiny, assumes command of Engineering, couldn't care less the ship was being taken apart right next to him, and finally, instead of being thrown in the brig as a timeout, he's *rewarded* for buying a few extra seconds for someone else to fix his problem?

In fact I realized that a lot of the season just wasn't very repeatable and because I just wasn't very compelled to watching the Klingon War stuff but that is literally 2/3rds of the season. And because its so serialized it makes it hard to just pick out an episode and watch it on it's own. But maybe others feel differently. 

But for me, I have only watched four episodes twice thus far. They are:

-The Vulcan Hello (being first and all)

-Context is for Kings

-Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Insane (and easily my favorite for the season)

-Lethe (literally just watched this a second time a few days ago and gave me the ideas for this thread)

But that's been it so far. I been thinking to rewatch the first MU episode as it was very good IMO but haven't done it yet. What's funny is I was excited about the show being on AA because its the first Trek show you can just watch over and over again without recording it. But haven't done it.

We've decided to run a little experiment this week. As our sub has grown and grown over the last year (at the moment we're averaging around 100 new subscribers a day!), we've started to feel like it's become less like a community and more like a bunch of strangers getting together to talk about something they're interested in.

530,"I've made several posts in the past about making my way through the Star Trek canon and recently I finished Deep Space Nine on my first run through. It is, by far, my favorite incarnation of Star Trek and I was truly sad to see it go. 

Once I finished DS9 I moved on to Voyager. Whenever I made posts previously, Voyager always seemed to get a lot less love than other versions of Star Trek. Some even cautioned me to avoid it altogether. Well, Voyager's first season is only 15 episodes so it has been going by pretty quickly. Today I finished season one and honestly I can't yet see why people disliked it. 

There are some things that immediately stand out as being a stretch...first off, the crew seemed to take the whole 70,000 light years and 75 years to get home pretty easily in the early episodes. I'd imagine if something like that happened in real life, there probably would have been a mutiny of some kind with Maquis personnel desperately trying to overthrow the Starfleet personnel aboard the ship. Further, Janeway seems to put a lot of trust in Chokotay despite having previously been in hot pursuit of him as a Maquis traitor. Making him her first officer and then immediately giving him all her trust seemed....fool hearty. I get that over time they would develop a good working relationship and she'd grow to respect and value his counsel but within the first 2 episodes everyone seems too.....chummy. 

That being said, this is more like TNG than I think I had thought it would be. They are exploring, meeting new species, getting into trouble, getting out of said trouble....it really reminds me of TNG in a lot of ways. Storylines don't seem to have the length or consequence that they did in DS9 and at least thus far I can't tell if there will be any major character arcs that will take place because there really hasn't been much previews of that thus far. 

I like Kate Mulgrew and I like Captain Janeway. Sure she's no Sisko....or Picard for that matter but so far, she's made decisions in all the ways I'd expect a Federation captain would despite their circumstances. Hopefully I'll grow to like her more as the series continues but I doubt she'll ever vie for my top spot which is currently a very close tie between Sisko and Picard (with Kirk as a close second). 

Anyway - just wanted to share my experiences so far. ",I just finished Season 1 of Voyager and I don't get the hate this show sometimes gets

532,"A while ago I saw some YouTube videos by someone who I will refrain from naming as to not shame them. In their videos, they talk about Trek lore. And I've noticed a serious disdain for Discovery and the fans of that series. He loves to be sarcastic about the flaws of the show, the Vulcan/Klingon first contact part especially. Yet he shrugs off other inconsistencies of equal merit and tries to reconcile them rather than mock them.

So this got me thinking. How important is continuity in this franchise? After all, there are a great number of inconsistencies of varying degrees of scale. Phasers supposedly able to obliterate planets, yet I can't recall them ever using more than a sliver of that power anywhere. Even during wartime when it would be justified. Then there's Voyagers ""limited"" torpedo supply, Picard not showing any real adverse effects to assimilation unless it suits the plot, solutions to problems never being mentioned again, I could go on and on.

And yeah, you could reconcile these, but so could you with the cracks in Discovery. It's hypocritical to throw those under the bus while brushing aside the rest. Trek has ALWAYS had errors in continuity. And personally, I can accept it. Past, present and future. I may make fun of them at times, but in the end, I feel they are part of Trek.

Why didn't Worf suffer and legal or career consequences for his actions in this episode. He took control of the planets weather control system. He clearly didn't have permission or authority to do it, and it's something that seems to have had a massive effect.

Not only that, but he gave control of the system to someone who seemed to be intent on destroying everything on the planet.

I don't think I'm overstating it when I say I believe his actions qualify as acts of terrorism. Or at the very least, aiding a terrorist.

543,"As the title says, what are your thoughts for a series that doesn’t focus on Humanity and the Federation? 

Personally, I think there’s a lot of areas to explore with a series about the Vulcan Expeditionary Group or the Romulan Star Empire as opposed to continuing on with the same premises. 

The galaxy is a very different place post DS9 and Voyager with horizons only expanding to the other quadrants. 


With the Federation, there always seems to be a powerful, oppressive regime to create a ""big bad” villain with each series. This helps alleviate the episodic-ness of each episode, but it's become a bit redundant.

* ENT had the Klingons.

* DIS has the Klingons.

* TOS was largely episodic with recurring villains.

*TNG had the Borg (this is especially where the magnanimous ""big bad"" took hold in the later seasons)

*DS9 had the Cardassian/Dominion/Jem'Hadar alliance, the penultimate big bad before the Borg. 

* VOY had, of course, the Borg.


With the Romulans, there is no true friend around to quickly broker tentative alliances with; diplomacy isn’t for making friends, it’s for *Romulan* security and staving off the wolves. A lone Empire in a sea of foes - the Klingons one  side, the Federation on the other, and a vast expanse of space we’ve never encountered in *Trek* at their backs.

For Vulcans, we could see what it’s like to be on the other side of the Federation. Fans often ask why the Federation seems disproportionately human, and I’d argue that the Federation is largely a human endeavor. That’s not to say that the Vulcans are along for the ride, but it very much reminds me of NATO and SEATO wherein the United States spearheads most initiatives. Such a premise opens the door for different perspectives and problem solving that doesn’t involve pointing the business end of humanity at the enemy — joint operations where cultures may clash a reluctance on the part of Vulcans to receive human help, even if it’s to their detriment.",What are your thoughts on a non-Federation centered series?

545,"Human explorers aboard Starships should be ""passengers"" who only labor because they want to, not because they are needed to. 
In effect, starships should be ""The Magic School Bus"" -- a fantastical vehicle that does not need human crews, but rather which takes humans where they want to go and which facilitates them educating themselves about the mysteries of the universe. 

Star Trek features peak humans, morally developed, disciplined, expert, and cooperative. And yet Star Trek has always betrayed anxiety about the usefulness and utility of even top-of-the-line homo sapiens. 

Mr. Spock, nearly-machine in his perfect logic, reflected the fundamental limitation of even peak humans. No one could hope to keep up with his encyclopedic knowledge and ability to make computations on the fly to several decimal places. Instead, the writers offered compensatory virtues in humans, such as emotional intelligence and intuition. This is only sharpened in the character of Data who actually is a machine, the one character on TNG who could have done the job of anyone else in the crew and frankly could have done it better if not just as well.  

TOS confronts the problem the usefulness of even apex-humans in ""The Ultimate Computer"" and the situation only resolves itself when the machine turns out to be psychotic, but this only delays the question. If the M5 was not ready for prime time, then certainly M6 or M9 would have been. 

By TNG the problem is a bit more acute with the ship's computer occasionally becoming sentient and sentient creatures being accidentally generated in Holodeck programs. Quite frankly, humans should not be needed to run the ship given the tremendous intelligence built into the ship's systems. 

Think of the economics of Trek. In the future there is (and is not) money. Trek can't make up its mind, however, what is clear is that people don't really need to work and that humanity is at a point where everyone can basically follow their passions as far as their merit will take them. No one goes hungry. There is no want, outside of career ambitions for limited posts in institutions like Star Fleet. In short, labor is not needed--people do what they want to do. 

Having a captain of the ship telling the Magic School Bus where to go next perhaps makes sense, but do helmsmen? Does it make sense to have engineering staff? Most ""jobs"" aboard the Enterprise are really superfluous. The idea of humans constantly laboring to keep the ship working is a downright ""steampunk"" idea given not only advancements in real-world information technology, but especially in light of the fictional assertions of show itself.

549,"The visual changes to Klingons over the years have been addressed in DS9 and Enterprise. The Augment Virus, which spread throughout the Empire, would likely have resulted in a negative social stigma towards infected Klingons. We know that during TOS, Klingons were still being affected by the virus (hence their human-like appearance), the Kelvin-Timeline films would've had to address this as well. 


In Star Trek: Into Darkness (as well as some deleted scenes from Star Trek 2009), [we see several Klingons wearing helmets that mimic head ridges](http://www.startrek.com/uploads/assets/articles/4761908541417785dacbf457963dd2b89c511612.jpg). These [helmets](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/30/57/e930573e12fd0e678c7812efa9920644.jpg) could have been used as a means to allow a Klingon warrior to avoid the negative stigma of looking human as a result of the Augment Virus' infection. 


The Kelvin-Timeline costume-designers used these helmets as a clever way of avoiding the continuity issues with the era, while still making it obvious that these warriors were Klingon. With the Augment Virus being established canon, the reason for these helmets during this point in Klingon history makes sense.

During the 2nd season (1967-1968) the few fans of the show feared NBC is going to cancel it.

BJo (short for Betty JoAnne) Trimble was a leading force behind the well played ""Save Star Trek"" campaign and the face of it. The show was renewed for a third season (with smaller budget and less favorable timeslot, but better than nothing) and was cancelled only a year later.

A disappointing result? On the contrary!

By the end of the 2nd season just 55 episodes were aired - too little for [syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication). The 3rd season however brought the total to 79 episodes and that was a syndication enabling number.

Syndication expanded the fan base. Most Americans who grew up on Star Trek, grew up on the reruns, not on the original broadcast. Syndication is what allowed Star Trek to become a phenomenon with such a deep cultural, social and technological impact.

556,"It honestly blows my mind that we’re still talking about the Klingons in Discovery, and for some people it seems like the second biggest deal breaker in the show to them (the first just generally being that it’s another prequel). 

Star Trek has been around for more than 50 years, and in that time we’ve seen multiple species change their appearances and at no time has the fandom in general had as big a problem with it as the current Klingon design. 

Of course, it all started in 1966, and the original Klingons were little more than goatee wearing [villains of the week ](https://i.imgur.com/wazbM1e.jpg), nothing special, not much to them really. Some classic episodes of course, and some memorable characters. The low budget forced this design choice of course. And this was the way of things until the motion picture changed everything. 

V’ger’s first on screen kill, a couple Klingon D7 cruisers that couldn’t handle the V’ger torpedos. Kirk &amp; company watch as these [totally new Klingons ](https://i.imgur.com/92Fatym.jpg) got waxed in the first ten minutes of the movie. Here we see the first bits of Klingon language, the armor, and at first glance these look like tng Klingons, but there’s some differences. The forehead ridges extend all the way through the nose, there’s no break at the ridge like Worf, the hair is kind of a mess for the usually well kept Klingons. They’re close to what everybody knows and loves but not quite there. 

Then we have the modern Klingons that everyone knows and loves. It all started with [Commander Kruge](https://i.imgur.com/quOU5OJ.jpg) the first of the quintessential Klingon. Marveling at the destruction of the Genesis planet and calling it beautiful. When pretty much any other actor (not named [Michael Dorn](https://i.imgur.com/YiEdI6V.jpg)) puts on the prosthetics, and plays a Klingon, they start channeling what Christopher Lloyd does in Star Trek 3. 

Now, I’ll acknowledge that Star Trek 3 to Nemesis/end of Enterprise is a long time, 20 years actually. So 20 out of 50 years of produced Star Trek this is what Klingons looked like. It feels a lot longer thanks to constant reruns and being able to watch on demand. 

Then came 2009, and the rebooted universe. And with it came New Klingons, most prominent in the relatively poor movie [Into Darkness](https://i.imgur.com/xL0PDvi.png). They’re close to the next gen Klingons, but decidedly different. 

Now, here we are at Discovery, and the so called [monstrosity](https://i.imgur.com/SdCrKZT.jpg) that is the new Klingon. So that’s 5 different version. Some subtle, some not so subtle. 

The show says they’re Klingons, therefore they’re Klingons. As long as the narrative is good, and the actors give it their best, what does it matter? 

Was the first season of Discovery the best Trek ever? No. But in my opinion it was the best first season of any Star Trek series to date. I’m excited to keep watching, I hope it gets better. 

But more than anything I’m thankful for Discovery, cbs all access, and all of you who like me cancelled it immediately after the season ended. Because of all of that, we have more new Star Trek and Sir Patrick Stewart is apart of it. 

So there’s my argument. 5 different Klingon versions in 50 years. It’s just another change. No big deal. 

Much like [this change](https://i.imgur.com/eQ5rrxo.jpg) to [this](https://i.imgur.com/7V93bDO.jpg) doesn’t bother me. ","Why I don’t care what the Klingons look like, and why you probably shouldn’t either"

562,"Every iteration that we see from TOS to DSC are just different selective breeds of Klingons.

The Klingons are very clannish and xenophobic, even with themselves.  The Klingon houses are very segerated and a very strict caste system is enforced which then reinforces the selective breeding process creating very different looks over the countless generations.  

For a real world example, look at dogs.

Dogs are highly unusual in their variation, from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane. (Recently, body size was found to be largely explained by differences in a single gene among dog breeds.) Darwin realized that man can force selection by picking particular individuals for breeding who show a particular characteristic that we want to see in our pets. So humans can accelerate the process of selection dramatically by exploiting the diversity naturally found in domestic forms and homing in on a form that is desirable. Natural selection usually acts more slowly, relying on what Darwin described as ""descent with modification""--the chance arrival of new forms through DNA mutation.

564,"Since we probably wont hear anything real about the new show for awhile I would love to see people pull out their creativity and think about what kind of show they would like to see.  With me I would love to see Trek continue to take the issues of today and tell some wonderful stories.   No judgement on anything you post.  

For me the show would open up Earth coming out of an almost 2 decade long period of isolation .  a terrorist attack on Earth by the Typhon Pact caused the death of millions, including the Federation President.  Earth pushed for all out war with the Pact but the Federation council denied such action and instead insisted on opening dialogue and engaging sanctions.  As a result Earth removed itself from the Federation.  20 years later Earth is under new leadership and there is a desire to rejoin the Federation community.  

The Federation welcomes them back but with conditions.  Most of the Starfleet ships are almost entirely crewed by non humans and the younger Starfleeters have not ever met a human.  They need to take things slow.  

Earth is given a Starship the USS Destiny.  (much like how in the past we saw Starships with only Vulcan crews).  A crew is assembled from Earth to man the new Starship.  The Federation has decided that they would like to add a few new job positions on board the new ship.  Ambassador Jean Luc Picard who left Earth with his wife and son is asked to join as the First Contact Specialist.   Picard's son is a teenager and doing his own thing.  Picard is looking for new challenges.  The new Discovery Captain has a certain amount of respect for him, but also doesn't want Picard stepping on his toes.  A new species that Earth has no experience with has joined in a ""social media capacity""  Her job is to broadcast a daily ""blog"" out to the Federation so that people can be energized by Earth's reentry. No one likes her position on the ship and find her to be too obtrusive, but understand they have a lot to prove to a galaxy that has done well without Earth over the past 2 decades.    Jamie Kirk is  the new helm the ship.  Earth felt that they wanted a name that had always been respected throughout Starfleet and history. She will have  a lot on her shoulders proving herself to her Captain and a universe that knows the name Kirk carries a lot of expectations.  

Destiny's first mission is Bajor.  The wormhole has been emitting some odd signals and the whole area seems to be cut off from communication.  Destiny arrives to find the Wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant becoming unstable.  There also seems to be some sort of time/space effect around the region.  Bajor goes from being a member of the Federation to in the blink of an eye a burned out husk of a planet.  Then moments later a Cardassian strong hold and then the whole planet disappears and only rubble remains.  Sciences determines that the time stream is in flux and its due to the wormhole, something inside is affecting time in this region of space.  

A crew is sent inside the wormhole were they find a small white ""egg"" emitting high levels of energy.   Inside they find a being.  They disconnect him from the egg and get him back to their ship.  Once outside the time shifts seem to stop and Bajor is back to normal.  The being is simply know as Morgan. The odd thing is that this person looks different to each crew member who interacts with him/it.  To Picard The Morgan looks just like his teenage son.  To the Captain the Morgan looks like an Androrian.  To the Social Media person the Morgan looks like her 80 year old grandmother.  The Morgan explains that he/it has no idea who they are.  He remembers driving down a road on Earth in his old Chevy.  Then a bright light.  Then he remembers an Earth where Humans ruled the galaxy through fear (mirror universe) he remembers a universe where Vulcan was destroyed.  He appears to exist outside of our normal time and space.  He knows he is here with Destiny for a reason because something ""big"" is coming.  But has no idea what.  He doesn't know if he will be able to help, just observe or actually be a liability.     He also cannot be removed from the ship.  The Captain of the Destiny decides to send him to Bajor and let Federation Doctors and Scientists figure out what is going on.  But moments after beaming him down, he is once more standing on the bridge with no idea why it didn't work.  It is decided that for better or worse Morgans Destiny lies with this ship and crew.

574,"There seem to be two camps of Star Trek fans:

1. There is the camp who wants to live in the period they were introduced in when they started watching the show, TOS, TNG, etc and wants a continuation or constant connections to those eras and characters. They love Star Trek but they want to stay with one particular show mostly.

2. And then there is the camp who just loves the concept of what Star Trek represents in itself and wants to see that concept expanded as much as possible always innovating itself with new ideas, time periods and characters. 

I believe the great majority of Trek fans are probably in the first camp but I could be wrong. But I look at the excitement with announcements of characters like Picard and Spock returning. Some people may have issues with them but the reception does seem overwhelmingly positive. Probably more so with Stewart since we haven't seen Picard for so long. 

But I know there are definitely people like me who wants to see Star Trek go different directions, different eras, settings, etc. DS9 is my favorite show for that reason. It took chances on a premise, story and production level no other Trek show has tried since. It was considered the black sheep of the family for a long time but now many have come to love it because it breaks out of the norms the other shows did. 

In many ways I was looking forward to Discovery because at least they went the direction of a new crew on a new ship and there were some changes to the old format like not having the Captain the main lead and rebooting a lot of the visuals. But I also feel being a prequel to TOS kind of weighed it down and while I look forward to season 2 more than 1 I can't help but feel it's going a bit backward by making Spock and Pike big additions next season. It almost feel like a TOS inspired season instead of focusing on its own characters. But that's just me.

I mean the academy certainly train you to deal to psychological trauma , Data also reads a lot, he also is interested in all sorts of art. How the hell did he thought that emulating a dead son's voice to a mother during the fucking mission would be a good idea? He could at least went to Troi and said ""counselor that old lady is gone""  and Troi would be like "" oh yes I sense a great unresolved mourning psychosis oozing from her, better call the captain"". BUT THERE IS MORE, after it all went down he than goes to her quarters and finishes the job of sending her mind to hell, at that point he should  had said something like this while emulating her dead son's voice ""doctor, I hope that you learned to never fuck with automatons ever again you basic bitch""

I've been a lover hard sci-fi/spec-fi for many years. I've known of  star trek but haven't come around to watching it until recently. I started with TNG.  it would be hard to describe the degree to which I've loved it. However, I just watched the first episode of the fifth season and it seemed like a betrayal of all I've completely loved about this show. I felt like turning it off mid episode and never watching the show again. Honestly I was scared to see something I came to appreciate and love so deeply disintegrate in around 10-15 minutes. I stopped watching.

I just want to know if my heart will be broken further with TNG. I plan to watch the others going forward but can you blame me for being attached to Picard and the feel of the Enterprise under his steady hand? What I saw was disgusting and it kind of.brings me to the larger point. Was it coopted by the network? I'm paranoid about this in part because of the speech the corporate hack ____ gave at HBO headquarters indicating they should push out more content and try to keep up with Netflix.whose business model is quantity over quality and would put out a miniseries about how different cats love to climb on or hide under large pieces of broccoli which I would I guess definitely watch.

Anyway I'm scared and I would appreciate some insight on how it plays out because it seemed like big bang theory episode (that is the worst insult I could muster) when I turned it off.

586,"So I’ve never watched any of the actual Star Trek TV series or movies, besides the JJ Abrams/Bad Robot films. With the hype around Sir Patrick Stewart’s return to the franchise, the hype and popularity of Discovery, and my constant hearing about Star Trek news and praise from Tested.com, Adam Savage, and Norman Chan specifically I decided to give it a try. I’ve existed within nerd culture for a while so I’m already familiar with many of the references, characters, ships, plot points, races, scenes, props, technology, themes, memes, and moments. I always liked the concept, but never decided to jump fully into it. I was surprised to see almost everything available on Amazon Prime Video. I started watching TOS remastered, with the pilot episode featuring Captain Pike and the gloriously campy cardboard graphics, and the first two episodes after that. I’m loving the experience so far, but I couldn’t help but notice how much better it looks so far than I expected it to. 

I mean, the pilot showed the Enterprise as a flat image superimposed on a spacey background, and then the next episode it’s a CG three dimensional object. It was a bit jarring, but as I’m more accustomed to modernized visuals in television it was more welcomed. I did watch all of the modern Doctor Who series a few years back and enjoyed that, so slightly campy sci-fi fun and diplomacy is right up my alley. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed what I’ve seen so far, and was shockingly surprised by how personal, deep, and adult the show is right off the bat. I guess I never thought of Star Trek as a kids show, but somehow I never expected it to deal with sexual themes and adult issues so quickly. I’m also super impressed by how progressive the show is, especially for its time. 

My question is though, will I be shunned by mega-fans because I’m watching the Remastered TOS? I have many friends who are hardcore fans of all thinks Trek, and I don’t want to talk to them, or meet other fans at conventions, and immediately have my thoughts and opinions disqualified by elitism or toxic fan-boy culture. I’m okay with watching it either way, and I know that most fans are more into with TNG than TOS, but I’d just like to be educated on the matter rather than ignorant. I’m not saying I expect negativity out of the community, but I’ve existed in nerd culture for a while, and I know how toxic things can get (insert The Last Jedi Opinion here).

598,"Seems to be a lot of people finishing their first watch of this Trek show in particular lately.

Since starting the franchise in January I've now seen TOS, the TOS movies, TNG, the TNG movies and now DS9. I've also watched the NuTrek movies and Discovery. This is the most material I've ever watched of one single franchise.

I have to say that out of all of it so far DS9 is my favorite. I love how you get to see the characters grow and evolve. You really get invested in their journeys. The fact that it really leans into having actual story arcs is just fantastic.

I don't think it was perfect, like everything it had it's flaws. I really didn't care very much for Bajoran politics and religion. Kira always annoyed me. In the beginning she's always shouting and whining, scrunching up her face and shaking her head around. Then she doubles down on her faith as well. Never really bought her relationship with Odo either. The ""will they won't they"" thing between them was a bit taxing.

Other than that it was little things, a bit too many Ferengi episodes, a little too much Vic Fontaine towards the end. The mirror universe stuff wasn't all that interesting. I like fun one off episodes just fine but I got so into the whole dominion war that you just wanted the one offs to be over so they could continue the main story.

Julian was kind of a creep that wouldn't take no for an answer when it came to women. Didn't really buy Siddigs performances whenever he had to raise his voice and try to be serious and commanding.

It's only a Paper Moon has to the single finest bit of Trek I've ever seen so far. This episode really floored me. I haven't been in a war or lost a limb but when Nog starts talking about how he's afraid to go out in to the real world and live a real life, and he's afraid of the fact that he doesn't know what will happen out there and that he can't control it. He'd rather stay in a fake world knowing that it probably isn't good for him in the long run but at least he knows what the future is going to be like. I really identified with that.",I've also finished watching DS9 for the first time [Spoilers]
599,"I find the fact that we're going to have multiple Star Trek IP's competing against each other to be beyond fascinating. I was too young to enjoy the TNG/DS9/VOY competition, in that I only got into VOY when it was on-air, rather than TNG or DS9.

At any rate, Patrick Stewart's Star Trek is going to go directly against Discovery, in that both will likely rotate airings within the same year. This means that after 20 years, we're actually going to get two Treks at once, which hasn't happened since DS9 ended in 1999.

We can see from this handy [website/graph](http://www.madmind.de/2009/05/02/all-star-trek-movies-and-episodes-in-two-charts/) that TNG enjoyed a huge advantage over DS9 of about 30-40% over most episodes outside of Emissary during TNG Seasons 6/7. DS9/Voyager's competition was much closer, at about 10-15% on average, although both consistently saw declining numbers each season, which is sad. Its humorous that all the Netflix data that's at hand (what there is of it) suggests that Voyager is actually more-watched than DS9, and possibly as much as TNG or even slightly moreso.

At any rate, what are your thoughts? Will Stewart-Trek get a CBS OTA episode like Discovery? If it did, I could see that one blowing Discovery out of the water, as Discovery abjectly lacks a big name star, whereas Stewart's fame seems to continue to grow into his 80s.

Myself, assuming that the series is pretty good, will be mired in the difficulty of obtaining exactly how many people subscribe to CBSAA because of Stewart-Trek. However, twitter, IMDB and other social media sites should be able to provide some sort of quantifiable metric. I think that we could see a DS9-TNG style difference, where Discovery is about 30-40% lower than Stewart-Trek.

613,I've finally gotten around to watching star trek continues.  I never really liked the original series but I guess I was kind of feeling nastalgic.  This will contain spoilers so don't read any further if you haven't seen it.  Anyway in the second episode the enterprise rescues an orion slave girl from a telerite ship.  Kirk is then ordered by starfleet to turn her over to the orion who sold her to the telerites.  He does everything he can to avoid it but he eventually hands her over.  He changes his mind and decides to go after her.  But she had caused a warp core breach in the orian's ship so it was too late.  What pissed me off is that the federation is perfectly willing to condemn someone to a life of slavery just avoid a conflict.  If you ask me peace at that price is too damn high.  Had I been in kirk's shoes I would have refused those orders then I would have given her a shuttle and looked the other way.  It would have been worth a court martial if that's what it had come to.  Kirk following those kinds of orders makes him just as guilty as the orians.  So the federation is perfectly willing to turn a blind eye to other people's suffering as long as it doesn't effect them.  How convenient that must be for them.  They let the cardassians ravage bajor for fifty years and didn't lift a finger to stop it.  Even when they were already at war with the cardassians.  They didn't have anything to lose by liberating bajor during the border wars.  I guess it just wasn't convenient for them though.  And of course the federation's desire for peace at almost any cost is what created the maquis.  And then the federation declares them criminals when they're actions are what created them in the first place.  And regarding the prime directive there have been times when starfleet captains have stood buy and let entire civilizations get wiped out because the prime directive prevents them from interfering.  It is unconscionable to follow a rule written on a piece of paper that says you have to do nothing when you have the ability to help people.  They're are rules and regulations and then there is right and wrong.  As far as I'm concerned right and wrong is what matters most.  So if the federation is going to turn a blind eye to the injustices outside it's borders then it serves no purpose.  It's member worlds live in a utopia while the rest of the galaxy lives in misery.  The federation is willing to turn a blind eye to anything that non member worlds do as long as they're interests are not at stake.  To me this is completely unacceptable.  ,The prime directive annoys the hell out of me.

It will also reveal certain unfair prejudices and bias against modified humans by the Federation govt. And so, within this dichotomy, a conflict arises between freed Borg seeking morphological freedom and the Federation govt whose prejudiced actions are based on historical fears.

There would also be internal conflicts within both the freed Borg and the Federation govt. between the extremes and moderates of each camp.

The moral of the story is that, no matter how close to utopia you may be, there is always a chance for your society to slip back into previous (less progressive) norms.

On the other hand, TNG is my favorite since childhood (and arguably even rougher on early seasons), but is more or less a gag-an-episode situation where not having early season development isn't going to affect plot comprehension, which means we can skip around a bit more to hit hot button episodes.

On the other other hand, she was in the room with me while I was watching through S5 DS9 and liked it as far as she could understand, so I know she does like DS9 for at least a few episodes.

663,"The idea is to mix a little of the old by adding in characters from the three 90s era shows, potentially set up a new Next Generation with the cadets, have a season-long arc, be just Starfleet enough, but the crew is basically on its own for an almost Indiana Jones-meets-Firefly-meets-Trek vibe.

The episode opens with Laforge visiting Picard who is working in the family vineyard, very similar to ""All Good Things"". Picard is retired from Starfleet and spends most of his time on archeological digs across the quadrant. He comes back home to check in on the estate, which is ran by his sister-in-law. Laforge knew Picard was back on Earth and decides to visit, which he does periodically. 

This time the visit is interrupted by one Admiral Janeway, who we see in a shot similar to her first shot in Voyager (where she visits Tom Paris at the penal colony). She wants to pull Picard out of retirement for one special mission that requires his style of diplomacy, some contacts he has made over the decades, and his archaeological knowledge. 

Picard initially refuses. He's done with Starfleet. However, Janeway appeals to his sense of duty and archeological side of the mission. Also, he will be given a ship and a small crew and will only report directly to her. He will have free range to direct the mission has he sees fit. She wasn't aware that Laforge was going to be there, but she sees this as her lucky day if she can also appeal to Geordi to join up as well. 

Janeway gives him the name of another person she has tried to get on the mission, but refused her. She hopes if Picard agrees to the job, he can convince her to join. This person is Annika Hansen, formerly known as Seven of Nine. She and Janeway have had a falling out over the years, but once she meets Picard, another victim of Bord assimilation, and hears him out, she joins up. 

They meet up with executive officer of their ship's crew: Commander Ezri Dax. She has moved into field trainer for cadets - her counseling background plus her Dominion War experience at such a young age gives her some perspective in guiding the next generation of Starfleet. Plus, she also has nine lifetimes of knowledge to fall back on. She flies the four of them to Picard's new command: a retro-fitted U.S.S. Stargazer (giving us the name of the show - Star Trek: Stargazer). 

Once arrived Picard is reinstated to the rank of Captain, Laforge the rank of Commander and chief engineer, and Hansen is given a field commission of Lt. Commander and head science officer. Dax is the XO and the small crew is made up entirely of cadets. One of the cadets is offspring of 90s era Trek crew (Kirayoshi O'Brien or Miral Paris or Natasha Riker-Troi, take your pick).

During the first mission, Picard uncovers some ancient mystery that could have broader implications for the entire galaxy. Some other players get involved and at some point during the premiere the Stargazer is attacked and the computer core is crippled. In an act of desperation Geordi uploads an AI program to stabilize the ship. This is Data's memory core. Data effectively becomes the Stargazer's computer system and appears to his old friends as a hologram. First he looks like Data from Nemesis (CGI de-aging of course), but comments on how old Geordi and Jean-Luc appear and chooses to age up his on visual matrix. This is not only to make his friends comfortable, but also a way to adjust to his new state of being. 

At the end of the first episode, Picard and his new command crew discuss the fact that the mission just got bigger than they originally were informed. Picard has it out with Janeway via sub-space communication (I personally like the holo version so we can have the two actors in the same room). He feels lied to, but he can't help that the situation has pulled at his sense of exploration and discovery. 

After the conversation with Janeway ends Picard is alone in his ready room when he hears a voice off to the side giving a snide remark about ""Katie"". Picard turns and there is Q. After a few minutes of insults and banter, Q finally gets to the point that Picard is about to uncover something ancient and dangerous. So much so that the situation has caught the attention of the Continuum. As a result, Q will be watching.

676,"As the title states this is my random pitch for a TNG movie, initially thought up in the shower and further expanded elsewhere. This is all from quick, random thinking, and maybe has inaccuracies, but....hope you enjoy!

Setting: 2385

Jean-Luc Picard continues on as captain of the Enterprise-F, the newest flagship in the Federation. Relations with the Romulans have been gradually improving since Picard's triumph over Shinzon, and a possible alliance is in the works. The Ferengi as well have fallen on rough times and are requesting entry into the Federation (something not necessarily popular with some Federation members). The main TNG crew remain on the Enterprise (Worf is back at tactical), with Riker off captaining the USS Titan. Data is still dead, and B4 is at Starfleet Academy undergoing continued training/rehabilitation.

General Plot:

The Enterprise-F is en route to Ferengi space to join an envoy to begin negotiations on their entry into the Federation. Picard is in his ready room staring into space with narrative explaining his realization his days as captain may be limited and his thoughts of returning to the family vineyard. Following this he hears a familiar ""phase in sound,"" and a look of annoyance comes over him as he turns to expect to come face to face with a previous hindering deity...only to be face to face with a aged humanoid figure he's never seen. The being goes on some diatribe about his distaste for the chaos in the universe caused by the multitude of species, and states following his peoples' ""trials"" the decision has been made for a ""final trial."" With that he snaps his fingers and Picard is suddenly on the bridge with his crew looking out the view port at an unknown multicolored nebula.

From here it will be revealed the Enterprise is no longer in the alpha quadrant and is in unknown space. Not before long a ship approaches the Enterprise, unnervingly revealed to be a Jem'Hadar battleship. Despite attempted negotiations an epic battle ensues finding the Enterprise victorious with minimal damage/casualties. However, Worf soon reports scanners are picking up various capital ships in the surrounding areas matching the following species:

Borg

Cardassian

Andorian

Vulcan

Nausicaan

Breen

Tellarite

Klingon

Ferengi

Xindi

Gorn

Hirogen

The Enterprise also picks up odd readings of other spacial phenomena (ex: nebulas, comets, etc) and even a few unknown planets nearby. 

As the Enterprise attempts to make contact with their allies Picard is paid a visit from Q (John Delancie). Q explains the visitor he initially had is a superior Q who has deemed the universe over-inhabited (based on the ""trials"" carried out by the various Q). He explains they have been transported to the ""Q Sector"" (puns...they're fun), a space specifically designed for this final trial. The Enterprise, along with capitol ships from other species, are there as a ""battle royale"" with the winner earning claim as the dominant mortal species in the universe, at which point the Q will eliminate all other species in the universe. Q, for a second time, is ""powerless"" in the sector and can only observe and not interfere, leaving the mortals to their own devices.

What ensues would involve the following:

1) Humans and their various Federation allies doing battle with other species

2) The Borg assimilate one or more of the other species, causing the remaining species to team up against them (cause F them right?)

3) The Romulans are revealed to be there (Tomalak perhaps?)

4) Species 8472 is also revealed to be there

5) An away team being sent to one of the new planets 

.... some other stuff too (as I think more on it)

Ending: (WIP, and open to changes of course)

Ultimately it'll come down to the Enterprise and the ?Romulans. Picard powers everything down and refuses to fight anymore. It's revealed the superior Q has been interfering in the trial. The Romulans power down too and refuse to partake. The superior Q deems mortal life no longer has a place in the universe, but before he can blink it out Q does something to defeat the superior Q, sacrificing himself in the process to save....mortals. The Enterprise is blinked back en route to Ferengi space with knowledge of what happened, but undamaged. At their destination they are joined by the USS Titan to begin negotiations (and Riker gets his screen time ha).

688,"Every Star Trek movie is just a scenario which the Enterprise crews ""hammed up"" for cadets, acting out a role that is then learned by a computer intelligence which dynamically acts out as close a version to the original performance.  For the TNG era, these were in the Holodeck.

Generations was a Kirk program that was never completed (Enterprise-B schedule of training tapes, which never developed into a series).  Thus, Starfleet reused the ""footage"" in the first Enterprise-D schedule training tape.

The Constitution refit, the Enterprise-B variant of Excelsior, and the Enterprise-E never existed.

Only TOS, TNG, and DS9 pre-first Defiant destruction (they didn't survive) are truth.  There were refit Connies, but they were refit in the assembly line (i.e.: the assembly line was upgraded, and refit Connies were built new).  ""Refitting"" the original Enterprise was just a cheesy way to bring it into the new era (cadets were training on new equipment and an older model wouldn't have made sense, but the training tape producers wanted the ""feel"" of the Enterprise ""legacy"")

The real Enterprise-B is the one we see on the wall in the conference room on the Enterprise-D, with no flanges.  

The Dominion War ending is unknown to us, presumably a bloody slog to a stalemate.  The holosuite data from the transporter accident was used to create the post-Defiant 1 training tapes.  Ezri Dax was not trill, and never on DS9.  She was a Public Affairs media officer who worked with Starfleet Training.  She's only acting out Dax because the symbiont complicated a reproduction of Jadzia from the holosuite.  

Thus, even though the DS9 crew was killed on the Defiant, everything post-Jadzia is just an imaginary history of the crew.

Enterprise-C is the one we see on the wall in the conference room.  The Yesterday's Enterprise C came from the past of the ""War Federation"" timeline, not the main reality.  But this Enterprise did return to the past of the main timeline, explaining Tasha Yar's daughter.  Thus the real Ent-C (conference room model) was destroyed at Narendra III by the anomaly, but the alternate Ent-C (the one on screen) returns to the prime timeline's Narendra III.  Guinan's intuition wasn't caused by reality being wrong.  It was caused by prime Guinan's consciousness co-habitating with war timeline Guinan's mind until the prime timeline was secured via the return of the war Ent-C to prime.  It all has something to do with Q, and something about war Picard being a dick to Q and so Q wanted to ""trade"" war timeline's future for the prime Picard's.

Q, in fact, subtly alters reality every time he interacts with Picard.  What we don't see is Q interacting with other, alternate Picards, since surely Q would know what his others are doing.  So there's a shuffling going on, and prime Picard is prime Picard for being the best.

In the end, the movies have some inexplicable and unlikely scenarios, and out-of-character moments for the crew members.  This is because they are imaginary history training scenarios.  The use of famous crew members is a consequence wanting to give the simulations more weight for experienced cadets, a sort of fun yet challenging reward for passing basic tests.

Do they believe their ideal fan is someone who holds GoT-esque watching parties or someone who rewatches episodes to find current social parallels? Do they believe their fans come back for the Shonda Rhimes-style drama or the Black Mirror-style scifi &amp; ethics? 

Similarly, it would be interesting to know how committed CBS is to Discovery being popular? Surely Discovery is critical to their plans for CBS All Access but does that add additional pressure to the showrunners? How will the that pressure change the show? Should we expect Discovery to target fans of the JJ Abrahms films, nostalgic TOS fans, TNG+spinoff fans, or are they focused on attracting new viewers?

All of these questions would give us a better idea of what CBS wants Discovery to be and where they're trying to take the franchise.

Thanks to Plex and Tautulli I was able to go back and look and see when this journey began for me. May 12th is when I started this series after having finished TNG the previous day on May 11th. 

I'm not going to lie it was a bit of a struggle in the early seasons (namely the first two seasons) to stick with it. I felt the show lacked focus and didn't seem to have a goal in mind for what it wanted to be. Oh boy how wrong I was. 

Three months - three months is all it took for DS9 to become my favorite incarnation of Star Trek after nearly 30 years of TNG easily being my favorite. Captains Picard and Sisko are definitely two very different types of leaders, each with their own leadership style and way of looking at their positions of responsibility. Previously I would have said Picard hands down was my favorite Captain with Kirk coming in a very close second. If you were to ask me now, I am not sure I'd be able to answer with certainty who stands as my favorite now.

I love how they wrapped everyone's storylines up. I think the only one who I was surprised at how they ended up was Rom - though to be fair, as Quark said he was the perfect man to lead this new Feringinar. 

I had really hoped Sisko would come back from the temple by the end but I realize why he didn't. 

Bravo....bravo indeed. ",Its over - My first run through of Deep Space 9 is over and I am so sad to see it go
727,"Don't get me wrong, ""Balance of Terror"" is an awesome episode and very much the cornerstone of what became of Romulans during the franchise's history. But at this point it has a giant asterix always hovering besides it, because so many anecdotes from this episode seem to be in disharmony with what was established further down the road in later series' episodes. When Scotty states that the romulan vessel only has ""simple impulse"" that not only flies in the face of its own design (it features two nacelles, even in viewing range of each other), but also what we see a century early in Enterprise where Romulan drone ships clearly are warp-capable. Also when Spock remarks that ""Invisibility is theoretically possible"" it is at least somewhat implied that it has not been notably achieved until then. Not only are there several species in Enterprise, including Romulans, using cloaking technologies, its deployment now is a major plot point in Discovery's first season. Next there is the general observation that neither has anyone in the Federation ever seen a Romulan (and realized it) ""nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication"" back in the good ol' days of the Romulan War from 2156-60. But there was, at least on side of the Federation predecessors and I don't see why the Romulans should not have had it either. It's a widely used technology during the time as seen in Enterprise. Furthermore it seems highly unlikely that there never was any romulan corpse floatig through space or lying on some ground battlefield and if there was that nobody cared to check what it looked like. And what did the Romulans gain by masking there appearances? If they had revealed themselves it would have spread mistrust within and towards their most powerful and advanced adversary in said war, namely the Vulcans. Everyone in their command structure could have been a Romulan. And it would have probably been even more difficult to determine who really was as it was with the Founders centuries later as there was at least one effective blood extraction test then.

Additionally, the notion that the Romulan Star Empire isolated itself for 106 years (and later again for 53 years) massively hinders all possibly development they could be subjected to. When new stories are in inception more often than not writers remind themselves that they cannot use Romulans in their story as they allegedly were absent from so many timeframes and it would ""break"" canon if they appeared. The second isolationist period in Romulan history from 2311-64 is already softened up a lot by having them fight with the Klingons at numerous times and Starfleet at least one time, Starfleet officer Stefan DeSeve defecting to the Star Empire 2349 because the ""strict moral compass"" they had projected outwards appealed to him and also they, probably the Tal Shiar though, acquire some genetic material of Jean-Luc Picard during those years - and why should they have chosen him especially if they did isolate themselves completely thus limiting the information they would have had about what happened within the Federation to know that he was an important enough figure to replace. So practically this second period is already at least reduced to 2311-40s and in my opinion the years from \~2344 until 2364 should be treated as a time of limited contact and gradual reemergence on side of the Star Empire.

Going back to the first isolationist period in Romulan history between 2160-2266, I propose that it either should be drastically shortened to open up more space for stories to develop Romulans in or also feature a time of limited contact and gradual reemergence beginning in the late 22nd or early 23rd century. As I understand Romulans it is very much in their character to disconnect from others occasionally, especially after suffering defeat or humiliation. But to keep these periods at the extend they were originally intended does nothing for them and also obstructs many storytelling possibilities or shifts those to other species thus leaving Romulans further behind until they eventually become a mere obscurity.

In conclusion, I hope that the writers of Discovery and any future incarnations of the Star Trek franchise disregard the background story established for Romulans in the TOS episode ""Balance of Terror"" even more than it has apparently been, because it would be more beneficial to them as it would be harmful. As much as has been retconned from this particular episode already it would probably be a good idea to also denounce the notion of a 106-year-long isoliationist period in Romulan history between the settings of Enterprise and TOS and in the process shorten and/or soften it up and also other statments like the unfamiliarity with the appearance of Romulans for storytelling purposes. *But what are your thoughts*?","""Balance of Terror"" while successfully establishing Romulans simultaneously hinders their further development since"

729,"So I had an idea that I think would be pretty cool. I hope the show is about Picard doing archaeology on alien ruins. They could feature him discovering relics and fleshing out a story of what life was like for these ancient aliens. So the show would feature an episodic story about an ancient alien world, punctuated by Picard in the present day discovering new relics and adding pieces to the story. They could even have fun cameos from other Trek characters helping Picard in their specific field. 

It would also be interesting if they weaved it into Discovery a little bit and gave us some back story about the Kelpians and other races of that time. Perhaps even explaining the very different appearance of the Klingons from Discovery's time.

What do you guys think? I think it's the only way for a Picard based show to be excellent. I can't imagine him being an Admiral at Starfleet Command, navigating bureaucratic red tape and what not. I feel that would make a boring show, but the archaeology could go any direction, even changing from episode to episode, or perhaps following one species per season in a sweeping story arc like True Detective had done.",Picard's new show idea
730,"No, Q did not alert the Borg to the Federation's presence and abilities (as Captain Janeway once accused/implied), rather he informed the Federation of the Borg's presence and abilities.  More than that, he tricked the Borg into believing that the Federation's technology was far more advanced than it actually was.

In the final episode of STTNG's first season, the Enterprise investigates some colonies with which the Federation has lost contact.  Being close to the Neutral Zone, the crew suspects Romulan involvement.  They find the colonies have literally been wiped from the face of their planets and later find that the same has happened to Romulan outposts near the Neutral Zone.  When, in season 2, Q sends the Enterprise 7000 light years across the galaxy to force a confrontation with the Borg, the first thing the crew finds is a planet that has had all signs of machinery and technology wiped from the surface in the same manner as the Federation colonies near the Neutral Zone (as Data points out).  So the Borg already knew about the Federation, and Humans, and had a pretty good sampling of their technological (although possibly not defensive) capabilities.

The Borg might have, and certainly COULD have, at this point swarmed and completely assimilated the Federation.  However, all of a sudden, a Federation ship appears 7000 light years away from anywhere the Borg would expect them to be.  We know Q is responsible, but for all the Borg know the Enterprise has a propulsion system far beyond anything they themselves have.  They take an immediate interest in the Enterprise and beam into Engineering to conduct thorough scans.  The Borg cannot find an unknown-to-them propulsion system that does not exist.  They are determined to chase down and capture the Enterprise attacking only it's shields as to preserve the ship so that it's secrets can later be assimilated without damage.  Just as quickly as it appeared in their space, however, the Enterprise disappears back into Federation territory!

The sudden apparent ability to travel long distances instantaneously likely caused the Borg to re-think their plans to dominate the Federation.  Rather than full-scale invasion, the Borg would merely send individual ships to continue to probe the Federation and learn it's capabilities in more detail.  Eventually Captain Picard, and other Starfleet captains would be assimilated and the Borg would learn about Q.  They would learn that although apparently troublesome, he was clearly on the side of the Federation and easily able to defeat them.  Thus, they learned to tread very carefully when attempting to attack the Federation.  Furthermore, just 5 or 6 years later.... *BAM* another Federation ship, this time Voyager, appears instantaneously on the other side of the galaxy.  ""Holy SPACE,"" the Borg must have thought... the Federation keeps showing up where they don't appear to be able to reach.  Whether by technology they cannot assimilate, or by help from aliens more powerful than themselves, the Federation apparently had a clear advantage over them that the Borg dared not risk everything to overcome.

By sending the Enterprise into a confrontation with the Borg Q forced the Federation to prepare themselves better, and caused the Borg to second guess their preparedness to invade.  Q knew what he was doing, he was saving his favorite pet!

However they would have known about the change during later seasons when they start being able to communicate with Earth. Even the EMH would have noticed when he was sent to the Prometheus.

* Picard- Crusher called him Jean-Luc

-It's commonly stated the first 2 seasons are below par...with S1 being nearly unwatachable.

-S7 is also considered a mixed bag and a massive decline from previous seasons.

-Most of the main characters, Pickard, Data and Worf aside, are usually heavily criticized as being underdeveloped and boring. 

-interpersonal relationships among the crew is heavily criticized as being too clean and nicey-nice.

-Only a handful of episodes are ever mentioned as genuinely good.

Here's the basics. I pose a scenario. And you need to think of a way to solve it using trek terminology. Be creative. I've seen some really cool stuff from this in the past.

*Reports have been coming in from the edges of Federation space of entire star systems going dark. You and a fleet of other ships have been sent to investigate. The first system you reach is home. Just gone. No star, no planets, no satellites, no interstellar dust. All matter in the system is just gone.*

*each star system you check is the same. Almost wiped put of existence. Then your sensors pick up something. A celestial body, perhaps? It's size is comparable to a red giant star, and density like a neutron star. And if your sensors are right, it's made out of... everything. Stellar matter, rocky elements, raw metals, alloys, organic elements, most any material one could find in an average star system.*

*one of your crew suggests an explanation, grey goo. A hypothetical end of the world scenario proposed in the late 19th century of self replicating nanobots that end up consuming all mater it comes across to make more of itself until the planet itself is nothing but the machines. Apparently it's been taken one step further and is actively consuming other stars and planets.*

*as it turns out, they're right. And it has spotted you. Phasers don't seem to do enough damage and it simply eats your photon torpedoes. It seems to ""reach out"" with appendages formed from the machines, as several unfortunate ships in your fleet learn the hard way.*

&gt; According to George Takei's autobiography To the Stars, early drafts did feature the Excelsior discovering the Bird-of-Prey's weakness and using their gaseous anomaly equipment to find it. According to Takei, William Shatner asked that the scene be re-written, arguing that Captain Kirk would never need anyone to come charging to his rescue. The second edition of the Star Trek Chronology states that the study was a long-term one and that Enterprise, as well as several other Federation ships, had been outfitted with such equipment.

Shatner's demanded rewrite was a terrible idea.

Sulu served under Kirk for how many years? He learned everything he knew from Kirk and as such, coming to his rescue would *not* have diminished Kirk in any way. 

In fact, it would have been a better display of Kirk's competence than having him rig up the torpedo: Kirk may be about to retire, but he leaves a countless number of students like Sulu who can pick right up where he left off.

That's a *far* better legacy than telling your elderly friends to cobble together a gas-detector. It'd even counterpoint with him never truly knowing and then losing his only son. Your children are your legacy, but Kirk has been able to continue his legacy in his own way.

(Just imagine an alternate universe where Shatner's ego didn't put off Sulu's captaincy for so long and instead we see a mentor/mentee relationship between them as early as TWOK which culminates in Sulu saving the day in TUC.)","Gaseous Anomalies, Sulu, and Shatner's Ego"

I've since finished TOS, Star Trek Continues (even though it isn't canon), six movies, TNG and now I'm five episodes from finishing Deep Space Nine. 

**Spoilers ahead**

I just finished the episode where the Defiant is destroyed by the Breen. The Breen/Dominion/Cardassian alliance is in peril because Leget Dumar has attacked a Dominion outpost and Jem Hadar cloning facility. Weyoun 8 is worried he'll be the last Weyoun because of this. Kai Winn (FUCK HER IN HER FACE) now knows this Bajoran dude she's been sleeping with is in fact Gul Dukat. She kills her aide and the book shows her the text to free the Pa Wraiths from the fire caves. Somehow through all of this Julian and Miles are still playing Alamo.

And all of that was in the last two episodes I saw!!! I am mourning the death of this series with a heavy heart and its not even over.

I think it's to say most of us get totally crazy knowing we are getting a new Star Trek show. And a lot of times because they come without warning. But I was thinking it would be fun to make a thread of how everybody thought when they heard a new show was being developed, from TNG to the Picard show! Of course if you were around when TNG started or at least when a few others did. 

I'll start first!

**The Next Generation**: This was obviously the first spin off, the one that bought Trek it's first Golden Age if you will. I was still a kid at the time and this was without the internet so stuff would just show up lol. And I remember seeing the first trailer for it (which I think is still on YT). I was a major Trekkie even still being in elementary school (seen TOS countless times and all the movies except TVH because mother didn't want to take me lol). Anyway, when it hit me a **NEW STAR TREK SHOW** was coming, I didn't know what to do. Seeing that commercial was surreal. And I remember running to the TV guide the second I saw it (ask your grandparents kids) and looking for when it was coming on lol. I thought it would be next week. It was instead four months lol. Four months felt like an ETERNITY to a kid but yeah exciting time. Star Trek was coming back?? Excitement Level (EL): 10! 

**Deep Space Nine**: This is a weird one because I remember just casually reading the newspaper one afternoon (ask your parents kids) and the entertainment section. And there was an announcement in tiny print that something called 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' was coming.  It didn't even say what it was, it was just two to three lines. It did mention it was coming the next year but that's it. And Avery Brooks was already cast in it. (THE GUY FROM SPENCER???) I thought it was going to be a new movie. After a few days I found out what it was, I was DEFINITELY excited because it was the first time two Trek shows would air at the same time. When I found out it took place on a station I was like WTF?????? A station??? But still VERY excited! Because it was so mysterious but it sounded so COOL! EL: 8!

**Voyager**: At this point I was kind of use to the idea we would get more Star Trek shows, but I THINK I heard this announced on Entertainment Tonight or something. I can't remember but I was excited. They didn't mention what the show would be about other than it would be on a starship again and we would have a female Captain. I don't know why I was so thrilled over having a female Captain lol, but I was! So yeah, still pretty stoked even if just two years after DS9 was announced. EL: 8!

**Enterprise**: Sadly I think my interest in Star Trek was waning at this point. There wasn't really a surprise because we were told for literally years they were planning another show when Voyager ended. It was the first time I was keeping up with the rumors everywhere and what it could be. The 'Birth of the Federation' show was always a contender. Then they made it official when they cast Scott Bakula in the role along with the name. Sadly it was kind of a ho-hum for me. I liked Bakula but the prequel thing didn't grab me. I told myself I would check it out but didn't care as much. EL: 5!

**Discovery**: I saw this one on the IMDB front page. It WAS a surprise. After a dozen years of no new shows, poof, there it was. I was definitely excited to FINALLY get another show but it mentioned something about a website called ""CBS All Access"" (WTF is CBS All Access????) and it waned a bit. I don't know I had a feeling it was going to be a cheap show thrown together. I was definitely wrong on that but I was a bit more cautious than the others but wanted a show of ANY kind at this point. EL: 7!

**Picard show**: As we all know this was rumored for a few months now, but I didn't know to believe it or not. And then last Saturday I was literally out the door somewhere but I decided to check up on TrekMovie for any news about the convention. And the first thing I saw was Patrick Stewart in that white T-shirt smiling over all the money he's probably going to make and my mind was fucking blown! I don't know why but I SO excited for it. I missed Picard, I missed the 24th century and it literally took me back to that time as a kid when I heard TNG was coming (didn't run to any TV guide's this time though). I was giddy then and I'm giddy now about it. EL: 10!


Sorry I always run on a tangent lol. So you don't have to make any essays, just a line and what level you felt going into each show (1-10). I know we are probably going to get Star Trek news like we get DC, Marvel and Star Wars these days but its an exciting time. I still want to be giddy hearing about the next one. I don't want to just shrug like what kind of happened with Enterprise. They do a good job, I won't. ",List your excitement level when you heard the announcements of past Star Trek shows introduced!

802,"The reason ""Enterprise"" makes no sense as the title of the fifth series is that its titular ship is neither the first Enterprise nor the most notable.

We know it's not the first or most notable because it is never mentioned in any of the first four series (set after) or the movies. The first Enterprise was the NCC-1701 (no bloody A, B, C or D), which was the ship whose crew told the story of the first series. That ship and their crew were mentioned in every other series. Because THIS was the Enterprise all other Enterprises are named after.

When Scott asks the Enterprise D computer to show him his ship, the Enterprise, Majel doesn't wonder if he means the NX Akiraprise. Why would it? He's not asking for the nuclear wessel Enterprise or the Generations Royal Navy sailing ship, either.

The fifth season Enterprise is absent from the recreation room of the TMP Enterprise (which does display a US Navy frigate, an aircraft carrier, a NASA orbiter and an early interstellar starship Enterprise) and from the observation lounge on the D (which also includes an aircraft carrier).

What I'm getting at is that the TOS, TNG and movie Enterprises are NOT named in honour of the ship of the fifth series, which has had no impact on the culture of the Federation (or on our popular culture); it's obviously the other way around. (Which doesn't make sense chronologically, but who's fault is that? Stop making prequels if you can't get basic continuity right.)

829,"Two friends of mine, Kyle and Daniel, recently wrote some interesting thoughts on why STAR TREK isn't as relevant as it used to be.

***KYLE:*** *""By the time TNG came along, some of TOS technology already was already becoming a reality and seemed dated for a show set so far in the future. People shrugged it off because TOS was an old show, and TNG presented a more modern look at what the 'future' looked like. Now, TNG-era technology is a reality. I'm using it to type this comment right now.""*

***DANIEL:*** *""Back in 2011, I went to a convention where most of the TNG cast was there.  During the big panel, Michael Dorn (Worf) began talking about Trek technology.  Dorn mentioned how one day, not long before that panel, he was at his home reading something on his iPad, and he had a sudden realization.  He was now holding in his hand a real version of the fake pads they used to pass around on the Enterprise.  The future happened.*

*""Trek just used to be more thoughtful about things; it gave people something to aspire to (which directly or indirectly led to innovation in the real world).  I think that’s one of the big things missing.  It takes visionaries to pull that off, though; and I don’t think we’ve had many of those connected with Trek in a long time.  Creators have been following technology instead of blazing ahead of it.""*

I wonder if this is why the writers have stayed in the 24th century, reversed to the 22nd and are currently staying in the 23rd. STAR TREK's future seemed so far away and now it doesn't.

When I was a child, I didn't really find TNG very interesting with its bland characters and robotic dialogue. But the world of the Enterprise-D enraptured me: a world of holodecks, artificial intelligences, androids, replicators, tablet computers, mobile communications. I longed to live there and now we do.

Surely by this point in the timeline they've either A) Figured out how to reproduce Soong's work or B) Figured out an even better way of making Androids.

With the theme of real life automation replacing jobs I think it would be relevant to have androids in mass production replacing Starfleet officers and civilians alike in large numbers. You could write stories about them putting people out of work (although in a post scarcity society I'm not sure that has the same impact). You could also write stories about them threatening to supplant their creators as a species or at least humans feeling threatened by their growing presence.

So here it goes.

I hope that Picard is retired, working on his family farm where his brother perished years earlier. Perhaps paying his respected when called upon for help by an old rival. Someone from the Tal Shiar. Perhaps Vice-Proconsul M'ret could have the Tal Shiar member contact him in order to facilitate the connection (M'ret defected in TNG: Face of the Enemy"" so has ties to the federation and Picard personally).

\- - -

Keep in mind this is in the original Trek timeline, not the Kelvin timeline. This means that Vulcan has not been destroyed, but it does mean that Romulus was destroyed by the supernova Spock tried to stop.

This series takes place 20 years after Nemesis (Romulus was destroyed less than 10 years later).

\- - -

This is 10 years since the Romulans have needed to rebuild. It's long enough for there to be some sort of foundation to society be rebuilt, and also for that reformed society to begin to crack. Picard would need to pool his resources within the Federation to help the Romulans. He has to do it without the official support of either, however.

...This is because some Romulans blamed the federation for not coming to their aid quickly enough. This was in the first of the new films of course and their primary motivation to attack the Kelvin and destroy Vulcan. This same sentiment is likely true for other Romulans as well. Because of this, the Federation and Romulans are again at odds and relations are worse than they have been in decades.

This would provide for some very dynamic alliances and relationships developing. We would see old friends as enemies, others choosing their friendships over loyalties. And on the flipside, we would see old enemies as necessary allies.

It has the potential for a lot of fun.

870,"[Here's the article](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/new-star-trek-reboot-starring-patrick-stewart-cbs-latest-all-ncna898121)

&gt;It’s a dream come true for a generation of “Star Trek” fans who grew up on the rebooted concept as well as spin-offs “Deep Space Nine” and “Voyager.” But it also represents a retreat by CBS from the progressivism of its first series on All Access, “Star Trek: Discovery.”

The main thrust of this article is to impugn the motives of CBS for producing a new Trek show starring a white male lead. It begins to do this by critiquing the racial and gender makeup of the cast and crew of TNG.

&gt;The show championed liberal values, but its the cast was more than 75 percent white and male, and the production team behind it was 100 percent both.

It draws a clear distinction between liberal values and the racial and gender makeup in terms of value, and places emphasis on the latter.

&gt;As a bonus, Stewart himself is openly liberal, championing women in the #MeToo era, discussing the lasting effects of domestic violence on society and campaigning for equality for all. He is that rare A-list celebrity who remains unsullied by scandal or hypocrisy.

In fact, the article goes out of its way to compliment Patrick Stewart for his liberal values while still calling his casting into question.

&gt;More likely, CBS is using the nostalgic reboot to placate the (white, male) demographic that felt alienated by the network’s first Trekkie reboot “Discovery,” a show which was legitimately diverse and therefore immediately controversial.

Here's where we get to the meat of the article.

I'm a fan of Star Trek: Discovery. I'll admit I was neither impressed with nor repulsed by its diversity. I feel like it has a lot of room for improvement, but its been more solid than the first seasons of a lot of the other shows. I'll also admit that Sisko is my favorite captain.  I'm intrigued by the prospect of a show with him because of his obvious talent, my love for the character,  and the prospect of finally telling stories in the post-nemesis era.

I guess what I'm wondering about here is whether or not ""older white fans"" are the only people who would enjoy this character. Is the appeal of Picard so narrow? Does the fact that they want to put out a ton of Star Trek content alter the variables in this conversation? Should Star Trek just avoid major white male characters going forward? What does everyone else think about this opinion piece?

Finally, I'd like to criticize Ani Bundel, and much of the rest of the media, for the misuse of the term ""reboot"". This is a spin off, not a reboot.",Opinion | Ani Bundel: 'Star Trek' reboot starring Patrick Stewart sends mixed messages on diversity

Of course its been two years since Beyond (which was a financial disappointment) and while we are getting more news about maybe two more films I feel the hype has really died with these movies.

I also know since the film takes place in another universe and not prime where most of us really care about it makes it even easier to think less about them now that we are getting some new stories in the prime universe. 

It could be a number of factors but I'm just curious am I reading that wrong or is it just lack of news in general that has turned down the discussion? Are there hardcore fans counting the days down to the next Kelvin film or has the movie franchise turned into a shrug with most folks?

First, thank you so much for what you've done for Star Trek so far.  I know we fans have not always been kind but other than perhaps JJ Abrams I'm not sure there's any one person who has done more to advance the franchise since Enterprise went off the air.

In 2009 I attended the opening night of your first Star Trek movie.  The buzz for the film was great, and the overwhelming happiness and positive vibe in that theater waiting for the film to start was like nothing I've ever experienced.  Even better, your film delivered.  Everyone left happy and hopeful for the future of Star Trek.  

Convincing Sir Patrick to return to the role of Jean Luc Picard also could not have been an easy thing to do, and it speaks to your considerable skill as an executive producer that you were able to achieve it.  

I was in the pavilion in Vegas when you introduced him sitting just a few seats down from the guy who yelled ""Holy SHIT!"" When Sir Patrick made his appearance the emotion was overwhelming and yet another feeling I've never had before.  That's twice you've pulled that trick, so again, thank you.

All that said, as a lifelong Trek fan and as a person who grew up with Jean Luc Picard as a hero and role model, I have two humble requests as you conceive this new chapter in his adventures.

First, while any reasonable fan should certainly respect the need to establish conflict, the necessity for there to be high stakes, and a problem to be overcome, please don't go ""Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi"" with the character.  A major flaw in Generations was pointless offscreen death of Picard's family.  I understand the writers' goal of making him face his mortality, but it was a cheap and frankly lazy way to achieve it at the expense of the character and that narrative.  

Obviously, not everything since ""All Good Things"" could have gone perfectly for Picard and I expect in two decades he'll have seen his share of failure and regret, but there should also have been fulfillment and achievement.  

Whatever situation he finds himself in when the series begins, I hope Picard's existing life can play the role of being something he must sacrifice to address whatever the driving conflict of the series ends up being.  As a character, he deserves good things in his life as the choices he makes and the manner in which he conducts himself should have met with reward in a society like the Federation.

Please don't have him sad, broken, or in exile due to some horrible thing he did or that happened to him post-Nemesis.  Rather, consider starting the series showing the kind of rewards behaving as a truly decent and honorable leader can bestow.  His character has always embodied an ideal leader and man whose discipline, even temper, and unemotional decision making allowed him to overcome every obstacle the cosmos and humanity ever threw at him.  His position following TNG should reflect that.  

If he's not a high ranking Starfleet officer, he could be a beloved professor, an accomplished archaeologist, the governor of a colony on the frontier, any number of things.  He will almost certainly need to leave this life behind to address whatever issues form the basis of the series' conflict, and I hope you'll use the fact that his life is wonderful to illustrate how high the stakes must be for him to need to step away from it.

Second, we don't need to know how he dies.

Until recently, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo lived forever in our minds.  I would be happy for James Kirk to have done so as well.  Logan was an excellent movie, but a death like Professor X's for Picard wouldn't do any service to the character or the fans.  

I hope that however long this new series ends up being we see a character who has done so much good for everyone he has come into contact with can end up satisfied and happy, and again ride off into the sunset on a hopeful note like he did at the end of TNG.

Again Mr. Kurtzman, I thank you for your contributions to the Trek canon and wish you much success with the new show.",An open letter to Alex Kurtzman regarding the new series with Patrick Stewart

898,"I recently finished rewatching voyager and started reading about the drama that transpired behind the scenes regarding Seven’s character. Not only did I discover that there is an active base of fans that strongly oppose her addition to the series, but it was also a popular opinion amongst the members of the cast, which did not like the idea of her sexualized character. 

My issue with this is... who exactly is doing the sexualizing here? Like the old saying goes, it really takes two to tango. I must agree, the actress is undeniably beautiful, but so is the bloody statue of David...but I can’t see anything sexual about either of them. In the beginning and all throughout most of the series, Seven had less of a sexual/romantic drive than Data... and that’s saying a lot. She, as a character, is not even aware of her own sexuality for the most part of the series. 

The fans, on the other hand, seem very adept at projecting their own...ehm...projections onto her character, despite the fact the nothing that she ever does or says come off as even remotely sexual, unless you have the imagination and hormones of a 13 years old. 

Janeway on the other hand, has a charming flirtatious personality. She is an actual healthy, human female who is aware of her sexuality and bound to the same biological instincts as all humans are. I felt much stronger sexual energy emanating from Janeway as a character than I’ve seen from Seven...who always seemed more like a child to me than anything else. Even Kes was more mature than her from an emotional and romantic point of view. 

And before anyone says anything about her catsuits and body etc, again, I must state the example of the statue of David. Yes, she has very desirable figure, and the catsuits sure do make a point of that, but she is not aware of her own sexuality or body. The audience is. A similar case to this is fetishizing vulcan ears. Vulcans themselves probably would be weirded out by someone actually sexualizing their ears. For them it’s just something that’s part of their body, no different than knees and elbows. 

Also, it’s not like they could have chosen an actress with a less appealing body, because it would contradict the borg idea of perfection. Their bodies are engineered to be perfect, from height to muscularity, metabolism, bones etc And since they all live, in a sense, naked, I guess it makes sense for Seven to wear simple catsuits that only serve as a way to cover her body. 

But I digress, I’ll I’m trying to say here is that I don’t believe her character was in any way sexual, but the audience interpreted it as such, because, I stated before, she is simply just beautiful. Any thoughts? ",What always bugged me about the Seven/Janeway dichotomy

Here's the truth of the matter, old Trek is never coming back, as much as you and I would love for that to happen, it will not, Paramount has to make money, and unfortunately, old Trek doesn't make enough money to warrant continuation.

Now, when JJ Abrams' Star Trek 2009 and Into Darkness came out, I hated them because they didn't respect the Star Trek franchise, they bastardized established characters, for me, Abrams' Trek was an unbalanced mess, they tried to put in more action and less science, because of that, the movies didn't feel like Star Trek at all.

However, DIS actually feels like ST, the characters, plot, story, etc, it feels like ST and we should be grateful for that, grateful that DIS actually respects the ST franchise and doesn't make ST into a Star Wars wannabe.

I’m sure that was the intention, but I’m glad they do their own thing and don’t really rely on getting someone similar enough to a previous shows character.

The Borg where a really cool villain. They where pretty terrifying, gaining on the enterprise even when they where near warp 9.  And the end of that episode with Gunnian saying that the Borg are after them now, I’m excited and nervous to see them again.

I enjoyed Riker a lot more aswell. Definitely proved his bad assery on that Klingon ship.

I really enjoyed some of the more serious moments. The season had some pretty good quotes. 

Finally, I was surprised how good Measure of a Man was. I’m a theatre major in college right now, and I’ve always wanted a stage version of something Star Trek.

935,"With the news that Patrick Stewart will reprise his iconic role as Jean-Luc Picard, there will be many newcomers to the series. Many of these newcomers will be younger folks who never saw Star Trek: The Next Generation when it first ran in the 80s and 90s, and there will likely be a return to the fold of fans who left the series after the TNG era ended.

There will be a lot of people looking for a list of great Picard episodes to watch. I'd like to aim this list at newcomers, rather than ""hard core"" fans. This is a list for those who want a quick introduction to the character of Jean-Luc Picard without watching the entire run of TNG.

There is some overlap with any list of overall Best Episodes of TNG, but I would argue there are some key differences between a list of best TNG and best Picard episodes. For starters, with this list I will focus on those that showcase Picard's character and Stewart's performance. Still, this list will draw only from""better"" TNG episodes. So, while arguably ""Encounter at Farpoint"" does an excellent job of introducing many aspects of Picard's character, I would argue that it's not a great episode, so it's not on this list. Similarly, ""Attached\*"" is nowhere near a top episode of the series, but it is on this list because it's such an important episode for the character, Jean-Luc Picard.

Without further ado:

THE TEN BEST JEAN-LUC PICARD EPISODES (in chronological order)

1. The Measure of a Man
2. Who Watches the Watchers\*
3. The Drumhead
4. Darmok
5. The First Duty
6. The Inner Light
7. Chain of Command, Part II
8. Tapestry
9. Attached
10. All Good Things...

\*If you're a total newcomer to Star Trek, and you're reading this because you want to understand why there is so much excitement over Patrick Stewart's return to the franchise, I would start with ""Who Watches the Watchers."" It shows what Trek really is--a voyage to a strange, new world, and it introduces the ethics and morality embedded in the series overall, all while showcasing the leadership style and personality of Captain Picard. Like many episodes of the series, the writing is strong, but it's really the performance of Patrick Stewart that elevates the material. It's a fantastic episode, and it feels just as relevant and well-produced in 2018 as it did in 1989 when it first aired.

936,"Let me start by saying that I haven't been a lifetime Star Trek fan. My dad would watch some episodes of TOS with me when I was younger if they were the only watchable thing on TV. I watched TNG for the first time last year and I absolutely love it, it's now one of my favorite shows of all time.

&amp;nbsp;

Once finished TNG, I decided to watch the rest of the series, starting with DS9. At first, not unlike the beginning of TNG, I found myself getting bored with most of the episodes. How can you compare just finishing TNG with some of the best episodes of a show to the beginning of a whole new series? Later episodes of season 3 started to change how I felt about the show, but season 4 has solidified DS9 as another amazing show. I am almost to the end of the season, but I had to talk about it. I feel like every character in the show has been getting great development episodes now. Two episodes that stand out to me are ""Crossfire"" and ""Body Parts."" 

&amp;nbsp;

I am usually sitting at home by myself watching the show, which does get quite lonely at times, but allows me to react aloud without weird looks from my roommates. At the end of ""Crossfire"" I had to pause the show. Odo's situation with Major Kira is paralleling my life right now, so it really got to me when he wished to break up their friendship instead of telling her how he feels about her. I just finished ""Body Parts"" and I actually teared up. I've never been a huge fan of Quark up until this point, but seeing how defeated he is at the end of the episode really got to me. When everyone on the station starts bringing him things to re-stock the bar I felt like, at least for a second, that he was grateful to have so many friends who cared about him. 

&amp;nbsp;

I never expected to have much of an emotional attachment to the characters in DS9 like I did with the ones in TNG. I honestly believe that season 4 of DS9 really shows how amazing a 40 minute story can be. You're able to humanize every character to the point that you can relate to nearly all of them on some level. I am excited to continue watching and can't wait for more amazing episodes!

938,"Patrick Stewart's announcement regarding a new Trek series featuring an older Jean-Luc Picard unleashes lots of speculations about new storylines and about potential TNG, DS9, and VOY characters who will make guest-appearances in the new series.

Many fans are expressing curiosity about possible relationship an older Picard will have in the new series. Long-term shippers are certainly hoping that Picard will finally settle down w/Dr Beverly Crusher, as imagined in the Trek novel series (which while giving a happy ending for the couple, sadly is not considered as a proper canon Trek).

Who would you like to see Picard having a relationship with in the new series. Will he marry the good Doctor by then, or would it be similar to what was portrayed in 'All Good Things' where they have divorced and she's now the Captain of the USS Pasteur? (keeping in mind 'All Good Things' just a possible future universe for an older Picard which was set up by Q).

Would you like to see Picard reconnected with some of the women he dated during TNG (e.g., Vash or Nella Darren (sadly TPTB would need to recast her, as the actress portraying Cdr Darren has sadly passed away). Perhaps a returning Ro Laren? (a good way to bring Michelle Forbes back to the Trek univese). And the unthinkable - but very interesting to watch - is that Picard will initiate a relationship with his long-term archnemesis Q :-).

950,"If you got to sit down with CBS and Patrick Stewart to pitch your idea for his new Star Trek series, what would it be?

My Hot Take:

Picard left the captain's chair ten years ago, taking a position as admiral, spending the last decade sticking his finger in every galactic dike you can imagine. The Klingons are on the prowl, the Romulans in disarray, Dominion skirmishes, etc. In the past 20 years Starfleet has moved far away from its mission of exploration, and has become a default military body by necessity.

Picard is sick of it. He can't worry about the politics anymore. He can't preside over wing after wing of exploding Miranda-class ships. He resigns his commission. He takes up a teaching position at the Daystrom Institute Archaeological Council. He wants to get back in the field, boldly going, etc. Starfleet, closing down several of its fleet museums, offers him the old Stargazer to use as a research vessel, but can offer very little in the way of logistics and support, and he'll need to find his own crew.  


He wanders into a bar on Deep Space Nine to find a bearded, sad looking drunk talking the patrons' ear off about the galaxy. ""You can go to the Gamma Quadrant? Big Whoop. I've seen it.

Wesley Crusher is no longer with the Traveler. He wasn't psychologically strong enough to take the things he saw and broke down. Picard hires him as his first officer, and they set out discovering basically the weird-ass history of the Galaxy, from the Iconians to the origins of the Borg, to who ever those dudes were who ""seeded"" the galaxy.

However, it doesn't seem accurate because Cardassian Union and Klingon Empire seem to be on the opposite sides of the Federation.  And in DS9, Klingons invade Cardassia.  Seems like it would be impossible for them to just go through the Federation space.

So, does a more accurate map exists?",Is there a Star Trek TNG galaxy map?

961,"I enjoyed Nemesis more than First Contact and First Contact more than Insurrection.

It's not contrarianism, and I love Frakes, but I found myself somewhat bored by the whole Die Hard thriller of FC. Maybe it's because I knew there were no real stakes having seen it many times before, and FC was one of my first Star Trek experiences but many years later it just doesn't hold up like the TOS films do. 

Picard is pissed off, he's riddled with PTSD, the Borg queen is using sexuality to manipulate Data, Lily is the voice of reason...yawn. The best parts for me were the intensity of the Deflector sequence (I didn't remember it very well and while I sort of knew Hawk was going to be redshirted, I didn't remember when) and Riker being tired of Zefram Cochrane's shit on Earth. 

I don't really care for the Borg, so a Borg movie is naturally not going to excite me - but I enjoy and rewatch the Voyager Borg episodes regularly (they're the only episodes of Voyager I do rewatch tbh) because for all that show's problems, nerfing the Borg by making them defeatable and somewhat humanizing and fleshing them out (ha!) was not one of them. 

People meme the Borg as cyborg zombies, but they strike me more as space-vampires - the little nanoprobe infection in the neck is a key visual reference to this. They infect you, you become one of them - it's just they're also zombie-like in their implacability and inscrutable motivations. I'm getting off-track.

Objectively, of course, FC is easily the best of the TNG films - it's well directed, the plot is cohesive, everything ties up in a neat bow at the end, it's got memorable lines and sequences and all the characters have something to do. *Assimilate THIS* lmao. Classic Worf, eat any good books lately? 

The reason why I liked Nemesis more I think has to do with a personal preference for Romulans over Borg and Shinzon as a villain and the theme of duality over the Borg Queen as a villain and the theme of revenge. Revenge was done marvelously in WoK, and while Nemesis retread Tapestry in a way, at least it went in a different direction than ""What if PICARD were the Khan in this scenario?!"" It's a good movie, but not my favorite of the TNG films but it does have my favorite moment in almost all the films - when Reg gushes to Dr. Cochrane, it just felt like a win, like if I ended up back in time and got to shake the Gracchi Brother's hands for inventing the grain dole (little rusty on my Roman history so bear with me.) 

That being said, I would rewatch FC over Insurrection any day.

Insurrection has a great premise, but the execution is so *dull.* For one thing, I find it incredible unlikely that the Federation would **EVER** sanction the forced removal of a people from a planet to curry favor with a group that is supplying the Dominion with Ketracel White - for what, a fountain of youth? The Federation, who have strict (and possibly infuriatingly annoying) genetic engineering rules based on one member world's pre-warp fuck-up, are going to go all Andrew Jackson so that the Dominion has one less Ketty White pump instead of, oh Idk, *blowing it up?* 

Another problem I had with it was the Ba'ku did little to engender sympathy with me. I could grok Picard's lust for vengeance in FC all day and night, as a former street kid who got used to seeing people my own age born into a world of privilege compared to my shitty hand I totally understood Shinzon's issues - but the Ba'Ku are space-amish who lucked out on a planet with fountain of youth rays. The only reason I sympathized with them at all was that the Son'a were total dicks, the Admiral was a total dick, and the Federation went against its very nature to remove them by sanctioning the alliance with the Son'a in the first place - otherwise they were boring space amish. 

I get it - the Son'a are on a timetable, and the lead Son'a (a villain so forgettable I don't know his name) wants revenge (good god does the film series never leave that one behind), and the Ba'ku have a right to the world they settled before the Federation really even existed...but at the same time, why do I actually care if they're removed or not aside the fact that *the Federation went against its own ideals to do it?* 

Like that's all there is to it, so much so that I've repeated myself three times! That's the movie! It's always memed as a glorified two-parter and that judgement is not wrong at all. The plot twist (OMG they're former ba'ku who rejected space-amishism!) is weak, because alright, they want to be immortal - but as soon as they leave their planet that's over. They'd have to return periodically if they decided they wanted to run a space empire - why don't the ba'ku have space rumspringa? Let the ones who want to experience the galaxy go out and have a couple decades of life on the spacelanes then decide if they want to be mortal or not? If fantasy and sci-fi has taught me anything, it's that an empire run by an elite caste of immortals dependent on a macguffin to retain their status and immortality is doomed to have their special planet carpet bombed. 

Is this ever addressed? Hell no, Big Son'a Dick just wants his revenge and throws a few fits - never does reconciliation enter his mind, what an asshole. I get Picard going ""oh you're actually warp-capable if you want to be? Uh, sorry. We'll leave. Our bad."" because we know Federation policy thanks to the episode First Contact. If you know about the wider galaxy and reject Federation hospitality and exchange, fine, call us if you change your mind, have a nice day. 

Ugh what a shit movie. 

I sort of liked how Riker and Troi got back together, that was a long time coming, but...it was kind of hashed together real quick and I feel like it should have come earlier. Also how funny would it have been if in FC, Riker ended up doing the nasty in the past-y? Ha. 

This is an awful write up so don't remind me. ",First Contact and Insurrection: some thoughts
962,"Jean-Luc was great at many things.  A man for all seasons.  But the thing that he excelled in the most and which I believe Patrick Stewart is most suited for as an actor, especially at his current age, is ambassador.  

One advantage of being an ambassador in the Federation is that they aren’t limited to one planet in the way Earth ambassadors are to one country.  But let’s bring it up a notch...

Picard should be in command of a vessel and even a group of vessels (perhaps with a not-too-distant rescue/escort group) in a position that solidifies the UFP mission of “seeking out new life and new civilizations” and making first contact or servicing relations with potential new allies or stubbornly neutral civilizations.  

His title should be something like “(Forward) Ambassador-General of the UFP.”  This should be considered a rank equivalent to a 4 bar admiral, answering only to SF command and the UFP council.

Don’t think for a second this will be boring.  First contact missions as well as diplomatic relations missions with worlds that have conflicted internal politics should prove extremely interesting.  

The show should also pass back and forth between HQ and Picard’s Diplomatic Ship Group and the various commanders, scientists, linguists, and other team diplomats.  An undercurrent of some secretive conspiratorial cabal at HQ who doesn’t want to make any more contact with “new aliens” because it is too great a security threat would be good too.

And it would be really great if we could get Deanna Troi (Preferably Marina Sirtis) at a minimum to accompany him.  Wouldn’t hurt to have Data (with Brent Spiner) experimenting with age-effects to feel more human.
