I feel the Lost Missions episode where the two of them duel Dooku exemplifies their style best, Anakin and Obi-Wan are often described as two halves of a single nearly unstoppable fighter, Anakin is their unrelenting offense and Obi-Wan is their unbreakable defense, sure, a lot of the Jedi fight side by side, but rewatching that aforementioned duel especially you notice that their movements blend into each other, compared to most other duels where the two Jedi just take turns. I feel it did a lot to lend legitimacy to the idea of Anakin and Obi-Wan being two of the most skilled and close Jedi in the order.",Anyone else love the scenes where Anakin and Obi-Wan duel side by side?

15,"Just my opinion based on liking the character. Not exactly thrilled with his character origins, but not disappointed either. I think that a Boba Fett movie would be awesome if it was done one of two ways.

1. Done like Dredd. It’s Boba Fett on a high value target... Possibly partnered with other Bounty Hunter(s). Post ROTS, pre ANH. Not a ton of locations. More of a showcase of his abilities tracking down a target, delivering, getting paid. Never removes helmet (possibly one shot where Daniel Logan puts on/takes off the helmet. Have Boba Fett played primarily by stuntmen. Not tied to any other films in any critical way. Just a small, self contained day in the life of Boba Fett during a challenging bounty. Violent, pushing the extremes of a PG-13 rating.

2. Post Return of the Jedi. Disoriented Fett escapes Sarlacc pit. Tracks Han back to Cloud city where Imperial holdouts are making one of their last stands. Tons of callbacks. Made about five years from now, uses Solo actors to reprise their roles with the Han and Lando scenes on Cloud City. Ties in heavily to Last Jedi. Boba Fett and Solo end up in a truce. Twist to the Boba Fett story is that we discover that Jango Fett had multiple clones of Boba Fett made, and they’re all active.",What I want from a Boba Fett movie

23,"In the Clone Wars, when Palpatine became displeased with Count Dooku, he outright force choked him from half a galaxy away.

This is far, far beyond what any other Sith can do. Even Darth Vader could merely force choke someone on the same ship as him, and that was with a regular human.

If Palpatine was so powerful, what was stopping him from randomly getting into holograms with his enemies, then force choking them immediately?",How did Palpatine force-choke Dooku from half a galaxy away?
24,"Hi /r/StarWars. So without getting into whether or not I personally liked the film, I wanted to offer my perspective on why I think people both rabidly love and intensely hate this movie. To me, it boils down to the nature of tragedy in fiction. I think it’s obvious that there’s nothing inherently wrong with telling a sad story. If you play your cards right, a tragic ending can be thematically resonant and provide catharsis for the viewer or reader. You may feel sad in the short term, but it’s ultimately an uplifting experience. 

But what happens when a writer doesn’t play their cards right? What happens when your story seems to be sadness and cruelty for the sake of sadness and cruelty? Then you are just left with those shitty feelings. You never get your catharsis because apparently there wasn’t any point to the struggles your characters have been through. It has just been sadness for the sake of sadness. 

I want to share a quick story about what gave me this perspective. I’m a big Batman fan and in the current ongoing series, Batman was supposed to be married. In the end, though, his bride-to-be calls off the wedding because she feels as though Bruce can’t be happy *and* be Batman. That left a really bitter taste in my mouth (along with a lot of other fans) because it’s one of Batman’s oldest cliches. Even in The Dark Knight, the most popular depiction of the character in modern times, plays with the idea that his happiness is incompatible with his mission. So when Batman is left at the altar, we’re left feeling sad and angry, but without any interesting reason for doing it. It seems like the writer is being mean to Batman just for the sake of being mean to Batman. 

Which brings us to the character of Luke Skywalker. There is no denying that TLJ turns Luke’s story into a very sad, tragic tale. He is broken and lonely in his old age. So why would a writer do this to such a beloved character? The answer is, to tell a story that is worthy of that sadness. Rian Johnson used that tragedy as thematic fuel for the narrative he was telling. Fans of the film will feel that the quality of the story justifies that kind of tragedy. Detractors of the film will gain no closure from the story, and are therefore just left feeling shitty and sorry for Luke. I think that’s why you see so many people saying the film left them feeling sad and angry after watching it. They never got their resolution, so those feelings just sit there and ferment. 

I’m aware that people have problems with TLJ that go beyond Luke’s treatment. I totally understand that. But if the movie had merely been mediocre in their eyes, people would have disliked it, not hated it as passionately as they do. 

TL;DR - Fans of TLJ feel that making Luke’s story a tragedy was justified by the story, people who hate the film feel that it did not. ",Why I think The Last Jedi was so divisive and the nature of tragedy in fiction
25,"I mean, I understand from a dramatic perspective that having guys picked off one by one adds to the tension, but was there ever a stated reason that three guys had to do the trench run together? Two just seem to sit there and do nothing but get picked off. 

I think one of them says something about ""holding off"" Vader and the two other TIEs, but quite how he was doing that escapes me. Unless they were being human shields, just there to physically block the Imperials from shooting the leader? 

Tactically, wouldn't it have made more sense to have the two wingmen out of the trench and ""higher"" (relative to the Death Star) than the leader, that way they could dive down and shoot at the back of any TIE trying to get onto the leader's six? 

Overthinking maybe, but I'm wondering if I missed an in-universe explanation for the tactic? ",A New Hope: What were the trench run wingmen supposed to be doing?

38,"So yeah, what do you guys think is the most efficient Star Wars fleet? Keep in mind factors such as limited resources and political factors.

​

Personally, I think my ""dream fleet"" would look something like this:

Primary Battlecruiser: Bulwark Mk. 3. The Bulwark has lots of cargo space, high firepower and great shielding, but is fairly expensive but is known for sometimes having complications in electronics and sensors, and I would obviously get that fixed. The Bulwark would be the main frontline ship for my fleet, having good shields and high firepower, plus the cargo space which could be used for fighters and troop transport.

​

Carrier: Venator-Class Star Destroyer. The Venator, thanks to its ventral hangar, can deploy fighters in record time. With some modifications to improve its hangar space, the Venator would make a great addition to my fleet.​

&amp;#x200B;

Corvette: CR90 Blockade Runner: Small, fast, maneuverable and very modifiable, the CR90 is perfect alongside the Bulwark and MC60 as a screener ship, dealing with fighters and smaller capital ships with its array of blaster cannons. This version would have some of its engines removed or significantly reduced in size to allow rear sightlines, making the ship significantly slower, but giving it a much more effective firing angle against enemy ships, and reducing any fuel or energy costs from the massive engine array.

&amp;#x200B;

Frigate: MC60. The MC60 is small, fast, and very durable for its small size, and would, in this case, be modified to have more point-defense cannons. It is also known for its ability to quickly release its load, allowing for clusterbombs, proximity mines or even just random scrap to be released quickly, giving the MC60 extra utility.

​

Superiority Figher: HMP Droid Gunship. This gunship is big, decently well-shielded, and has huge firepower, and independently rotating cannons, allowing it to attack multiple enemies at once. This fighter, being very expensive, would be fairly rare, but would act as a great supportive element for the cheaper fighters, especially with its variety of missiles.

​

Swarm Fighter: Droid TIE Fighters. The Empire has experimented with droid-controlled TIE fighters, and considering the way TIE fighters are designed to be used, this sounds like a great idea. These TIEs would have a redesigned wing pattern to make them a little smaller, and be more easily crammed together in a ship, and would be released in large groups together, using their droid nature to coordinate group attacks and have great reflexes. These TIEs would be given photon bombs instead of missiles, and would be commonly used for risky mass bombing runs and as a screen against enemy fighters.

​

Special Ordinance: Repair Missiles: Special missiles filled with small droids similar to the Buzz Droids from the Clone Wars, but instead of tearing ships apart, they would repair them. These would help extend the lifespan of fighters out in the field, especially the HMPs.

Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith The Videogame

To everyone here on Reddit who likes Dueling and/or PVP/PVE games, and/or also like  Star Wars and the untold lore around Ep. 3. This game is for you! i love  this game personally and have beaten it many times.

it has  superb combat and amazing duels against classic characters as well as  characters not introduced in the movies, as well as fighting against  never before seen droids and clone fighter types. the levels in game  explore famous scenes from the movies while going much deeper into the  plot, narrative and story-telling.

Along with a versus mode where you can plug in a second controller and try to best your friend/enemy in a test of skill and might!

Above is a Unlock-able Alternate  Ending. no need to explain, just watch the video, it show cases the  beautiful combat and story-telling the game has to offer.

i could  go on for days about this game and love it from the bottom of my soul.i  sincerely hope you will love playing it as much as i do.

You will have to get your old PS2 or OG XBOX to play this. And as long as your console works well enough, you'll be able to play this game  buttery-smooth and lag-free. Despite its slightly low level graphics, it  makes up for it in fluid story telling and gameplay and Lore-Expansion. ",Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith The Videogame
43,"All other Star Wars movies (Disney or otherwise) did very well overseas except Solo.  I personally didn’t think it was that bad of a movie and thought it was better than the one I liked the least (Attack of the Clones).  So what was it?  Just the fact that people didn’t like the Han Solo recast?  I mean they had to know it wouldn’t have made sense to have Harrison Ford play the part.

",So I am looking for a serious opinion here. Why do you think Solo didn’t resonate with the foreign markets?
44,"I’ve noticed throughout the Star Wars Saga that 4 different colors of blaster bolts/ship laser bolts are used:

Red: Rebel blasters, Stormtrooper (Empire and FO) blasters, CIS blasters and Droideka/SBD wrist guns, X-Wings, A-Wings, Rebel Y-Wings, Rebel turbolasers, Vulture Droids, various factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Blue: Republic Blasters, Resistance Blasters, Ion charged weapons, when any gun is set to stun it fires blue circles, Republic Y-Wings, Republic turbolasers, various different factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Green: TIEs, Imperial turbolasers, Naboo Royal Guard blasters

Yellow: Mandalorian blasters


But I’ve never seen a satisfactory answer as to what they all mean in universe.  Obviously outside of universe the different colors are simply a design choice to make the battles look more colorful and to keep track of who’s who, but in universe it kind of seems like it should have an explanation.

I’ve seen a couple explanations, but none feel quite right:

1. The color is equal to the quality/type of gas used to create the bolt.
This theory posits that red bolts are lower quality gas, blue bolts are ion infused gas meant for taking down electronics/droids, and yellow and green are simply higher-end/more expensive gas

I like this theory, except it exposes a few problems, mostly with the blue gas being ion infused.  Blue bolts are used by both the Republic and the Resistance, along with many pirates and smugglers in TCW, if blue gas was ion infused, it would make sense for Clones to be using it as it would be more effective against droids, but the Resistance and the pirates in TCW would have no reason to use it.  Also, if blue lasers are better at taking down electronics, why wouldn’t all ships have blue lasers, regardless of faction?


2. The colors don’t change anything about the bolt, it’s simply a “tracer” or a way to know who’s firing at who.

This theory has more real world relevance, as real bullets will sometimes be used as “tracers” that leave little marks of color behind as they fly, this allows the shooter to see where he shot and readjust his aim accordingly, as well as to keep track of who is shooting what weapon.  This makes perfect sense in the Star Wars universe, except when it comes to the Rebels and the Empire.  If switching between colors was as simple as flipping a switch, and if it was common practice to use a different color than your enemy, why would the Rebels have kept their blasters at red?  It wouldn’t really make sense...

So, that’s why I’m curious if any of you guys have any theories or ideas as to what the different blaster colors could mean?

I know it doesn’t really matter, but I’m a sucker for these nitpicks details, and exploring the deep Star Wars Lore is one of my favorite things to do","So, can somebody give me the lowdown on Blaster Bolt colors?"

82,"Okay this is just a minor thing but seeing as how I'm reading the book where this happens I felt like talking about it. I feel like it because it is my favorite book in the entire New Jedi Order series and includes one of my favorite Space Battles in all of Star Wars. A battle that is akbar's last great act. 

Destiny's way is all about being a turning point. not for the characters because most of them have already completed their major arcs for the series but for the war itself. And Akbar is front and center in this book. He is treated as this Wise Old Statesman who is sick and dying but wants to Still help save the Republic. He is shown being tired and physically frail and not being able to be out of the water much while still being intelligent and even having the president and the current leader of the galactic Navy offering him their spots.

At the end of the book he comes up with this large multi-layered trap that destroys the enemies ability to wage a offensive War. Sadly he does technically die off screen but he dies at the end of the battle so it's sort of a somber moment doing this great Victory where is the heroes realize that they have lost this great Statesman who was the one who gave them this victory.

now let's compare that to the ackbar we see in The Last Jedi. Instead of getting multiple scenes with the main characters and having one of the minor plots revolve around him he is in the background of two or three scenes. His death is also treated as just a minor footnote it happens in the background and he just gets lumped in with everybody else that died during the attack.

so yeah he did die off screen of peaceful old age in a book where he is Central to the plot of defeating the enemy. and yes books have more time than movies to develop characters and plot and blah blah blah but the book with all of its Pages didn't have to include Ackbar.","""at least Ackbar didn't die off screen like he did in Legends"""

101,"Before the Jedi knights or Sith came into existence. The force sensitive people were known as the jed'aii. 

[This video is more in depth](https://youtu.be/zVtYgI8B_18)

They came before the jedi, and, unlike the jedi or sith did not get involved with planetary affairs and instead kept to themselves and focused on meditation on their home planet. But one thing I noticed is that their teachings are not focused on the dark side, or the light, their goal was to balance both dark and light. 

I could not help to bring this up because the first thing I thought of when hearing that was supreme leader snoke. Supreme leader snoke was obsessed with the balance of dark and light. He didn't only use the dark or only use the light. He used both the dark and the light, balanced. 

Even more so snoke leads the first order. And the jeda'ii were the first order to study the force. 

But one thing I hear you say is ""the jedaii were aincent, if snoke were a jedaii he wouldn't be alive.""

Then I ask you to look at Darth nihlus and Darth sion. Both Sith powerful enough to cheat death. If you use the force enough you can cheat death and keep yourself form dying form at least old age. Not necessarily form other people (ie: kylo killed snoke) but he can at least keep himself fkrm perishing from at least age. This would be why snoke hid himself in the outer religions until the Emporer was killed. Because he knew the Emporer was a threat. He could keep himself form dying form aging but he could stop himself form being killed by another force user. This is why he looks so disfigured, because he is so old and he has used the force to stop himself form death and most decay, but still ceases to look alive.

Personally I want it all back and don't see why it couldn't happen. Maybe with some tweaks. It would be awesome to see Shadows of the Empire produced as an animated feature or a full theatrical live action film with a fully recast Luke and Leia. 

I have great memories specifically of the musical score that was released alongside the novel. And I never owned an N64 but still managed to play the shit out of that game at a friend's house.

Anyhow, I think there is a lot of potential in SotE, so many iconic characters and world building.

115,"SPOILER WARNING - MENTIONS NEW MOVIES

So I've seen all of the new Disney Star Wars films, and despite all of the great and horrible missteps that they've made, one thing is really ticking me off. Where were all the jedi masters when Luke's New Jedi Order was massacred by Ben Solo/Kylo Ren? Ben attacked because he though Luke was going to kill him, and somehow destroyed the entire temple? We know that after Order 66, roughly 2% or 200 of the Jedi survived. Of these 200, about 100-140 were hunted down and killed by Vader and the Inquisitors or were turned to the dark side. So that leaves roughly 60 Jedi, if the stat I saw was correct. Now not all of these Jedi would join the new order, as some were opposed or self-eciled themselves. But at least some had to return, right? At least a dozen, if not more, of the Jedi would have rejoined to help train the future Jedi. But somehow, some untrained padawan-level Jedi is able to get a few of his friends and just destroy everything? 

And I know that those numbers are from the legends universe which isn't canon ectera ectera. But at the very least, what about the Jedi who Luke was training before Kylo/Ben? Kylo/Ben destroyed the New Order somewhere between 28 and 34 ABY. If the second Death Star was blown up in 4 ABY, then Luke had roughly 20 years to train other Jedi. Where were these ones? Or are we ment to belive that Kylo/Ben, who was the equivalent of a padawan learner, was able to gather a few of his friends and topple the rest of the Jedi who had been training for at least 20 years? And that each and every one of the New Order Jedi just happened to be at the new temple at the same time so that they could be killed by Kylo/Ben?

130,"Hi all,

Like most kids, my son loves all things Star Wars.  He especially likes listening to Star Wars audio books in the car.  Currently he is listening to the kids ""read along"" versions of the original trilogy, which are heavily abridged and only about 15 minutes long.  I grabbed a copy of the ""Dark Forces: Soldier of the Empire"" audio book from the library and I was blown away!  It had great voice acting and sound effects.  My son was enthralled listening to it.  Unfortunately it hit on a few too many adult themes (genocide, etc) for a six year old so we had to stop listening to the disappointment of the entire family.

So I'm searching for recommendations for another audio book along the same lines.  I like the dramatic ""radio play"" style of storytelling from the Dark Forces book, and the length seemed about perfect (2 hours).  I'm a lot less interested in the long unabridged versions of the novels.  Does anyone have any recommendation for similar books with less violence and adult themes?  It doesn't have to be kids versions of the stories, adult versions are fine, so long as they are appropriate.  I'm especially interested in audio books with the same level of production polish.",Star wars audio books for 6 year old?

135,"Luke didn't just see Ben Solo's future, but also his own, on the night he saw that Ben Solo was lost to the dark side. From that moment forward Luke knew he had two choices, *kill Ben Solo*, or *allow Kylo Ren to destroy everything he lives to protect*.

Luke is in a sort of purgatory on Ahch-To, he knows that if he joins The Resistance in battle he will eventually encounter Kylo, and when he does he will be faced with those two choices, *killing Kylo* (the choice he is disgusted with himself for even have considered for a brief moment), or *facing his own death*, and dying the way Obi-Wan did in his duel with Vader in A New Hope (allowing Kylo to strike him down will further strengthen the dark side's hold on Ben Solo).

Luke sees that living the life of the legendary warrior *Luke Skywalker* means he has to face this decision. So he walks away from his life as *Luke Skywalker*, removing himself from the story that is unfolding across the galaxy, and living the life of a farmer on Ahch-To, the sort of life he once dreamed of escaping on Tatooine before his name became legend. 

It's not until Luke sees a way to meet Kylo in battle, without having to make either of these choices, that he is freed from his *purgatory*, and becomes one with the force having completed his journey.

- Yoda had beheaded the Commander (and I believe 2nd in command also) of Green company, meaning the clones would be somewhat disorganized
- The droid army was still very much active and engaged in live fighting with the clones so factions of the military would still be occupied with that
- Luminara was a well renown Jedi Master who could have proved very useful in the fight against the Sith

Ultimately we know she was captured and used as bait to trap and kill other Jedi who had decided to brave the apparent danger and tried to rescue her.

I feel this would have had the same wow factor to the kids, with less cheesiness to the adults. It would have also kept more in line with Yoda as a character, and shown his clear superiority to Dooku. It also would have kept more suspense for the moment Yoda finally draws his saber in battle against Sidious, then shown his small reguard for it when the sabers were cast aside as strength in the force became more the deciding factor. It would explain why Yoda never trained Luke on saber technique and focused on the force. He knew what Luke was going to have to defeat, and that a lightsaber would be a mere toy.

* 5 Planets have been destroyed and have done nothing to rouse me to action


After TLJ:

* The Rebelsistance military is virtually non-existent. A small city's police force could handily defeat them at this point.

* Luke Skywalker is dead. Regardless of how ""inspiring"" his death was, it doesn't change the fact that the most valuable asset against the First Order did no lasting damage to it and is gone forever.

* Every ally the Rebelsistance had has abandoned them. 

* The Rebelsistance has suddenly grown a moral opposition to purchasing/using weapons in war. Of course, this doesn't really matter since 17% of the Rebelsistance's forces made a point of destroying any relationship they had with the galaxy's arms dealers, going so far as to steal the personal ship of one of their sellers.

Those who weren't killed by clones were decimated by a sith who stormed the jedi temple killing everyone in it. She also found out that the Republic that she swore to defend was being controlled and manipulated by a sworn enemy of her religion, who also orchestrated the downfall of her former mentor.

If they explore the galaxy in it's post civil war state and treat the espionage scenes with at least a little seriousness I'll be very happy with it.

238,"By the end of TLJ, the New Republic is established as being dead (which pisses me off tbh), Luke is dead, Leia will also die, the resistance has no fleet, no allies, nothing. Just some slave children telling stories while the FO ""takes over the major systems"" in just a few weeks. So what really is the point of fighting?

Let me explain.
 By the end of it TLJ we are back at the Status Quo of the original trilogy, with the Empire (FO, cheap) now ruling supreme and the Rebellion (Resistance, very cheap) now back at being underdogs. But by all we see so far in universe, at least what we can infer, no one really gives a damn about the FO destroying the NR's capital, either the planets just bow down to it or are indifferent. This we can see by how none of the ""allies"" responds to Leia's pleas, and how the FO keeps saying that with the Resistance destroyed the last breath of the Republic will have died out. 

So maybe Kylo has a point, why are we still holding on? What is the point of keeping with the Idea of Republicanism, Resistance, Rebellion, whatever if there is nothing worth fighting for? If the galaxy actually gave two shits about liberty and justice they would've been up in arms and be in mass to fight against the FO, but they didn't, not even after the destruction of their secret weapon (Starkiller) and a major part of their forces. It's just the resistance and their miniscule ""fleet"" and abysmally small numbers and soldiers who see what the ground tastes like. 

What is the point of a Resistance if there is no real end goal to the resisting when no one actually gave a damn about what the first Rebellion, Luke, Leia, Han, and so many others fought for... Maybe we should just let the FO reign and be content with the fact that the Republic is dead, liberty is gone, resistance is futile, and all our heroes are failures.

256,"TLDR at bottom

It’s not like a huge annoyance but one of those things that kinda piles up over the movies and takes away from the experience for me. Thinking about the new trilogy, stealing spaceships happens a lot and it’s never really addressed or explained a lot of the time. Here is the list I could think of off the top of my head.

1. TIE Fighter stolen by Finn and Poe. This one makes the most sense thematically and logically. Finn needs a pilot but probably could get them onto the ship with whatever you need to start TIE fighters as he is a member of the first order. Interesting escape ensued, fun times and totally acceptable. Also note that the first order immediately gave chase. 

2. Millennium Falcon stolen by Finn and Rey. This one was the first time I really rolled my eyes at the new movies. And not getting into flying the ship, just the act of stealing it. Like was it just sitting there unlocked, fueled and ready to go? Wouldn’t space ships have some sort of defense system so you couldn’t walk on and just start it up and go? Also if you add in the fact that the Falcon would be well known (probably the only ship to help blow up both Death Stars including physically being the one to blow up the second), wouldn’t it be a prized possession, like a historical artifact almost, not just some piece of junk you leave laying around for someone to steal. It kinda felt like the last action hero when Schwarzenegger could find the keys to any car by looking in the sun visor. But I don’t think it really hurt the movie that much but was an eyebrow raiser for sure. 

3. Resistance ship stolen by Finn and Rose (with Poe’s help?). So before Finn and Rose go on there horrible Las Vegas vacation, they take a ship from the resistance to get there. This is stealing because earlier when Finn tried to escape via escape pod, Rose was given the oh so important task of making sure people didn’t desert the cause. So if they are guarding the fucking escape pods (I mean she was morning her sister but clearly there was standing orders to stop any deserts or something) I’d imagine that actual space ships that can go to warp would have more security to prevent the same thing. It makes some logical sense they could start the ship and maybe fly it (Finn has been established that he is not mechanically inclined so maybe rose knows how to?), and Poe probably had to like convince the guards to look the other way Or something? But wouldn’t they notice a ship missing? Did no one see it leave or detect it leaving with their scanners? It seems like an obstacle that would have been interesting to actually see (instead of say, a pack of alien horses running through town?) This also establishes that ships are now stolen off screen with little effort put into what happened. 

4. Libertine yacht stolen by DJ and BB-88. Like the first entry, this makes a little more sense as of anyone, DJ’s character specializes in this sort of thing and I’m sure some dumb comic goes into it, but it happens entirely off screen. A side note, how did they know where Finn and Rose would be to pick them up? That was lucky considering they didn’t seem to come up with a plan prior to escaping. Whatever, talented splicer with droid that can do anything steal a ship, believable if not very convenient and entirely not explained. 

5. FO shuttle stolen by Finn and Rose. Jesus Finn has be a part of stealing like 5 ships so far. This one is the laziest, their shuttle just shoots out of the main ship after holdos sacrifice. Uh what? I doubt Finn would still be able to get codes to start the shuttle and I imagine more storm troopers would be piling into these to flee the sinking ship or go down to the surface where the rebels are. So like these shuttles just sit around unlocked, fully ready to launch, just waiting for anyone to walk on and go? I mean can you just walk onto an aircraft carrier and hop into a fighter and take off? Wouldn’t a military organization have some sort of protocols for launching spaceships? Again, super convenient and done 100% off screen. But hey at least some fighters gave chase! Which leads us to

6. Supreme Commander Snoke’s escape craft stolen by Rey. I lied last entry, this one is the laziest by far. I mean this isn’t some shuttle or TIE fighter, but the head guys personal craft. What? How? How did she even know this was a thing? How did she get passed any security procedures? Why do we never see this craft? Also remember how I mentioned that the FO gives chase after the other two ships are stolen (numbers 1 and 5), were there no Fighters sent after this? If this was like Air Force One wouldn’t it have its own pilot and crew just in case of emergency, does like joke, sorry Snoke, fly this craft by himself?! Wouldn’t they know something was up if Snoke’s personal ship left and like send guards to the throne room? So many questions and the amount of explanation is one throw-away line. 

7. Salt speeders by the resistance. Ok this one isn’t really “stealing” because I think they said it was an old rebel/resistance base? But it is similar in the idea of ships just magically appearing to serve a plot purpose. It makes kinda sense that they would leave equipment behind and the ships seemed not in great condition but I feel this would be a great spot for a scene like the end of a new hope or beginning of empire with people running around prepping speeders, quick repairs, refueling, pilots getting ready, etc. like establish these speeders and set it all up, build the tension. I only saw TLJ like 1.5 times so maybe this happened but I sincerely can’t remember. Also, this set up scene is where you should of had rose confront Finn about not going out to kill himself and stops him by revealing her feelings. That would make a million times more sense than the speeder crash idea. 


TLDR: So there you have 6 (or 7) times that spaceships, shuttles, space yacht, and fighters have been stolen in the new trilogy and while some of them have made sense (mainly only the first time), the majority are either illogical, happen off screen, seem exceedingly convenient, or are a big missed opportunity for an interesting obstacle. And while these things in themselves don’t make the movies bad, they are like little needles that add up with all the other stuff to lessen my enjoyment of the movies.

260,"They have already done solo and I think now they should stop, the spinoffs are planned to explain many of he iconic characters in the old trilogy like Obi Wan and Boba Fett, and I honestly don't want them. Everysingle character does not have to be explained fully, I mean, Boba Fett, he is a bounty hunter, he hasn't got a fully explained story because he doesn't need to, you could say he's a pretty mysterious character, his backstory is not that clear, and so tell me why would we need a full movie for his backstory? This can only do more bad than good, an iconic original character potentially ruined with a painful movie spinoff, I really don't think its worth the risk to ruin some of the best movie characters in history.

I personally believe it's better left untold, all that can come out of it is a ruined character, if you don't explain the backstory then you don't have to get hundreds of people disagreeing on how it should've went, it seems to me all the spinoffs are just a moneygrab, because there is simply no need for they're existence. What might interest me however, is maybe a ""Snoke"" spinoff, explaining who Snoke is and how he became so powerful, that would be much better, because TLJ didn't do a good job at that at all, and just killed off his character instead.

261,"I think the resistance knows they’re in trouble and need alliances. I think we know they go Lando, who probably has knowledge and connections. One key bit of intelligence is the location of a “retired” Admiral Thrawn (Matt Smith). Thrawn has no allegiance to The First Order... in fact, Snoke’s species is a rival to the Chiss Ascendancy in the Outer Rim. The resistance wants to recruit Thrawn, convincing him that the FO is a danger to the Chiss.

Now, this potential storyline would have been a lot more viable if Snoke was still alive, but there possible ways around this. I think Disney wants to keep tying the universe together with familiar characters. Thrawn is a favorite and the latest book shows his alliance is primarily Chiss and he is honorable. 

Of course, Thrawn vs. the FO wouldn’t be fair... he would easily destroy them, so that’s kind of a problem too, unless more of Snoke’s kind show up to be a rival.

In the vein of familiar faces. Is there any reason we may not see Enfys Nest in IX? It seems like she would be the perfect age now to show up. Armor a little more worn and grittier, but maybe a disillusioned.

262,"Then it all clicked. 

The mass conspiracy of the Empire to continue along their treacherous path and the illuminating answer to the plaguing questions of who the parents of these remarkable children are.

Star Wars, the clone theory.

Who are Rey's parents? What about Finn? The answer doesn't have to be a furtive affair clandestinely glossed over to not blemish otherwise pristine Jedis. The empire has access to and uses cloning technology to build war machines however they were largely unsuccessful in and of theirselves and only useful as cannon fodder to swarm more powerful enemies in hopes of crushing their foes. Even though they ultimately were successful the next logical step wouldn't be to continue to clone Boba Fett, it would be to clone powerful force users to ensure that each individual member was powerful in their own right. 

Using access to genetic data on hand it would be possible to reproduce great force users throughout history and have an unstoppable army indoctrinated from an early age. However instead of training these individuals to use the force and potentially usurp the mantle of Sith lord they were instead trained as fierce soldiers who would use their latent force abilities unconsciously to ensure their own survival and ultimately the aims of the dark side. It all began with the creation of Anakin. 

After spending half a lifetime attempting to create the most powerful being in the galaxy and claim them as his apprentice Sidious obviously saw the folly of attempting to subvert a force that seemingly had its own will and fickle whims that would supersede any of his strategiery. Why ask the force to create powerful disciples when he could use technology at hand to do so and not have to comb through astronomical expanses of space to find them. Worse yet the arduous process of having to have to reprogram them to his will, a task only made increasingly difficult if they're already diametrically opposed to him. Thats not even taking into account what would happen if this being were to grow more powerful than their creator on their own cognizance and refuse to bow down to an inferior master. 

The only sensible way to create a new disciple that would stand up to the might of Vader would be to tap into the most powerful force user that Sidious knew, one who would make a worthy disciple and had a natural affinity for the dark side of the force. Unbeknownst to anyone while the events of the original saga were occurring a nefarious scheme was taking root that would reverberate through the protagonists lifetimes and beyond.

The pieces are in place.

Something happened between Luke and the Knights of Ren that made him abscond to the nether reaches of space. Was he running away, had he finally given up his lifelong pursuit of justice and peace? Maybe he discovered a nefarious plot and decided to exile himself and his historic midichlorian count to keep it out of the hands of a new sinister overlord. 

Something happened to Snoke that left him horribly disfigured and scarred (seemingly by a white hot light saber). Even then there are so many unanswered questions. Who taught him the ways of the Sith? Why is he such an incredibly strong force user when such people are ostensibly only one out of tens or hundreds of billions? Why does he seem to match descriptions of Darth Plageuis the Wise? How does he have such intimate knowledge of events and details he simply wasn't around for? It just seems like such a Sidious action to clone his mentor to claim as a secret disciple for the inevitability of Vader's demise. It also falls in line with the expected machinations of the Sith Lord. It even stands to reason that after being brought up in the wings the Plagueis clone picked up where his master left off knowing full well of his own lineage and setting off to gather the necessary components to eviscerate the last bastions of the Jedi, even succeeding where his master failed; he would cultivate powerful force users and ensure they were loyal to him to amass an army the likes of which has never been seen. 

Something happened to Rey, who are her parents and why does she have such an indelible and incredibly strong affinity for the force? Why did she only see herself when she went seeking her parents in the dark side cave? Why would someone (presumably Luke) try to hide her on a planet where nobody could find her as opposed to giving her shelter with loved ones as Ben Kenobi did? A Kenobi cut down the first Skywalker, why not try to clone another Kenobi to take out the Skywalker again? If she were a Kenobi then surely Luke sensed it in the force and presumably that's why this small harmless child was singled out to be protected from sinister forces, otherwise why would someone care so much about an unseeming, random child ?

What about Finn? Just some random janitor in a faceless, nameless organization and yet Kylo Ren was fully aware of who he was - almost as if he was keeping tabs on him. How does a lowly janitor get into a lightsaber duel with a Sith master and live to tell the tale? Just like Princess Leia just because force powers aren't bursting forth doesn't mean they're not nascent. Still waters run deep and who else but one of the most renowned light saber duelists in Jedi history to clone in an attempt to fortify your foot soldiers. If this were the case it would be likely they've been tracking FN for a long time but have had doubts about his proclivity to the dark side. When Kylo Ren suddenly turns to him after not participating in the massacre of the first movie was indicative that he was paying particular attention to his actions. More glaringly why would he choose this lowly janitor to accompany him and why would he remember his call sign out of the possibly thousands of soldiers stationed at that very base. Kylo doesn't continue throughout the movie referring to each lowly storm trooper individually. 

The new Star Wars isn't some shoddy rehashing of a formulaic and arcane tale but rather the last vestiges of a cold and ruthless emperor whose cunning is still being felt through the galaxy. ","Star Wars, the clone theory."

280,"My idea is that in Episode IX, Kylo calls to his grandfather. Vader’s force ghost appears, and as he walks towards Kylo he morphs from the Vader suit to ROTS Anakin, played by Hayden. Somehow through this conversation (where Anakin would try to convince Kylo to the light, tell him to not fall down the same path he did himself) Kylo would reject his fanboyism of his grandfather. 

Now, we know that Kylo’s saber needs two extra blade-ports because they help stabilized his cracked kyber crystal. I believe that the reason he goes through the effort of  using a cracked crystal is because it’s the crystal from Vader’s saber, which was cracked after being destroyed in the destruction of the second Death Star. Kylo would reject this now, as it was a symbol of his obsession over his grandfather. He would somehow end up with the crystal from Rey’s (partially destroyed) saber, and he would bleed it to the dark side (this would look amazing in live-action, IMO). Rey would use Luke’s greensaber to fight Kylo in the climax of the movie, and after defeated him she, alongside the force ghost of Luke (and if we really want to step it up: Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin), would purify it back and it would turn white on the Wellspring of Life, the force planet Yoda visited in TCW that was the source of midichlorians and all life of the galaxy.

The movie would end on Luke, Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda’s force ghosts all together, peacefully watching as the Resistance truly restore order back to the galaxy, and Rey begins training a new generation of Jedi with her purified saber.
I like the idea of the saber being bled and purified because this saber has been through everything, and been wielding by all of the most powerful force-users: Anakin, Kenobi, Rey; Kylo (who bleeds it) then back to Rey as she purifies it on the Wellspring or Life, which I’d love to see. Such a cool concept for a planet that we haven’t seen more of.

I'll keep it simple and ask where does the Clone Wars start for you? While Canon says its with the CGI 2008 show starting with the Episode Cat and Mouse, my concern is thatmany things arent really introduced/explained. For example: Anakins changes, Obi-Wans changes, Grievous, Ventress and more. Its like they were all tossed in and for all of us who know go ""oh yea! I remember you"" but most people who follow whats ""canon"" will still wonder. When did they come into play? I know Star Wars doesnt always need an intro for characters/things, but the 2D 2003 Clone Wars cartoon, while in the later episodes have some continuity issues and is considered no longer canon, had a pretty solid start to the clone wars, introductions, and character changes. It could also easily be considered canon just for the first 21 episodes alone (which is like an hour and 15 total). So I personally feel like that is where it begins.

Lucas brought to Foster the original screenplay, after which Foster fleshed out the backstory of time, place, planets, races, history and technology in such detail that it became canonical for all subsequent Star Wars novels. When asked if it was difficult for him to see Lucas get all the credit for Star Wars, Foster said, ""Not at all. It was George's story idea. I was merely expanding upon it. Not having my name on the cover didn't bother me in the least.""

The New Republic was a complete failure, and chose to ignore the First Order threat, and they were destroyed for it.

The Resistance numbered about 400 people *before* they were nearly completely destroyed by the end of The Last Jedi. In the entire galaxy, only 400 people are willing to fight to destroy an objectively evil organization. 400 people. That's about the size of an elementary school.

Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh, and the good ones. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join.""

There are no allies of the Resistance. Leia says she has allies, but none of them choose to help. Nobody in the galaxy cares whether or not the First Order takes over or not.

Crying as I type this, last year around this time I began heading down a path that I am neither proud of, condone, nor would I ever go down this path again; I won't say what. Shortly after this journey of mine began (four months or so), my girlfriend of eight years finds out that she's pregnant. She'd spent most of her adult life thinking that she was unable to conceive, not wanting children this didn't bother her much.  But finding out she was going to be a mother made her the happiest I'd seen in quite some time. At first we were hoping for a girl, we even had a name picked out, Eevee Rose. But we found out early on that we were having a boy.

​

We thought hard about a name and she kept suggesting Kai (taken from the TV show Lexx). I liked it, but I wasn't sold on the idea that we name our son Kai. At this point he'd already been through hell, so I knew he was a strong one (more on that later). A few days passed and out of the blue it hits me, Ky-ber. She could still call him Ky for short and I get to name my son after something Star Wars. I threw the idea out and she wasn't quite sold on the idea until I explained a few things. You see at this point, maybe five months in and he had already survived so much. He survived the morning after pill, a sub-chorionic bleed out and a miscarriage scare. I told her that I wanted to name him Kyber for two reasons, kyber crystals are strong (and this kid was strong, I knew it from the moment I heard his heart beat), and kyber crystals are the most precious thing in the universe to a Jedi, same as my son to me.

​

By that I'm referring to the moral grey area that the Jedi Order was painted in in the movie and the other grey and more serious themes they introduce not so subtley into the movie that resonate with real life (like the military industrial complex thing).  I'm not opposed to the idea that the Jedi may be a little in the grey area morally, there is a lot of arguments you could make for this but this isn't something I want to hear about in a Star Wars movie this is stuff that should be very subtle and left to fan interpretation not overly stated.

Its all part of the wave of postmodernism that has infected everything.  I'm not even against postmodernism because there's a lot of truth in it.  A lot the time things are not what they seem, things a lot more relative than we think, and often times the bad guys aren't as bad as we think and the good guys aren't as good.  In REAL LIFE things are pretty grey.  BUT THIS IS A FUCKING STAR WARS MOVIE I watch a Star Wars movie to get away from real life I don't want to think about how in real life things are more complicated and greyer and not as simple.  This is fucking star wars I want a cool space adventure movie where we know who the good guys are and we know who the bad guys are.  I want a simple tale of good vs evil, and blah blah blah.  Pretty soon itll turn out that the Predator hunts because its the only way it can feed its species, or its species is held hostage and forced into it like no dude the Predator is a fucking badass Hunter who don't give two shits about your life and is going to cut your head off and rip your fucking spine out!

&amp;#x200B;

Call me a nostalgic fuck but I miss 20 years ago when it was okay to have a simple movie about good vs. evil.  Like don't get me wrong I really like complex stories that show how morally grey life often is, ""subvert our expectations"", question our perception of reality, question if there even is a right or wrong.  Things like Rick and Morty, American Psycho, Taxi Driver, 2001 Space Oddysey, A Clockwork Orange these all are fucking great movies with fascinating philosophical questions that make you ponder a lot of stuff.  BUT I DON'T WANT THAT IN FUCKING STAR WARS.  This is WORLD WAR 2 IN SPACE WHERE THE BRAVE FREEDOM FIGHTERS FIGHT THE EVIL NAZIS.  If you want to have some morally grey stuff that's fine, but don't have Luke Skywalker blatantly say it.  Make it subtle.  Surprisingly George Lucas actually does a decent job of it in the prequels.  You never think about it when you see it, but when you rewatch it for the fifth time you actually wonder how much better are the Jedi than the Sith in all reality? Were the Separatists the good guys? Who'da thought George Lucas could do subtlety.",The Last Jedi's moral grey area in Star Wars thing
387,"I just rewatched for the first time since seeing it a few times in theaters (thank you Netflix). Now that most of the [dust](https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/324/171/cc1.gif) of criticism has settled I wanted to watch and try to see how I felt it fit in objectively within the context of all the Star Wars movies. I realized pretty quickly that it's actually really hard to do that without the final movie of the trilogy existing yet. 


Think about all the other Star Wars movies that have been reshaped and made better by the movies that came out after them. To me, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones would be nothing without Revenge of the Sith which ties that trilogy together and makes all of the movies better and more worthwhile. I didn't live through it but I'm sure Empire is even better if you know the conclusion it's leading up to in Return of the Jedi. Not to mention the entire OT holds so much more weight thanks to the Prequels and Rogue one.


My point is- I think people are over-eager to dislike The Last Jedi and should reserve some judgement until the trilogy wraps up. Are there issues with it? Sure. Can a strong conclusion make a lot of them non-issues or even advantages? Definitely. 


Maybe a bit more controversial: I would argue that Rian Johnson set it up perfectly for IX to do just that. He gave characters flaws that made them hard to like but if JJ gives them great redemptions then we'll learn to appreciate their struggles in TLJ instead of be frustrated by them.


tl;dr: Patience, you must have. If you hate TLJ now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.

391,,What are you excited about for episode 9? I am struggling to get hyped like I was for 7 and 8.
392,"Basically this is a ""how i would have done it"" so bear with me if you will. Right off the bat my first change is Luke being still connected to the force. He's still on his little island but he's in a different state mentally. Instead of having decided to completely cut himself off from the galaxy he's arrived at another unhealthy extreme where he's obsessively devoted himself to finding a way to redeem Ben.

 Having pulled his father back to the light, surely the great Luke Skywalker could do the same for poor little innocent and frightened Ben Solo now right? The problem here is that it's not like Ben can't be redeemed, it's that he doesn't want to. We've seen his conflict many times after all, he is still capable of good but he is doing everythinh in his power to beat it out of himself. With Vader he was carefully manipulated tricked, seduced and betrayed into the Dark Side. He didn't ask for it but after everything that happened to him it came naturally to him so he assumed the role willingly, it suited him after all. Ben actively sought out the Dark Side out of his misplaced admiration for his grandfather and it is what drove him to Snoke.

 Speaking of him let's get back on track. Luke becomes obsessed with learning about Snoke (sound fammiliar). In my version he's looking for the first Jedi Temple because he believes Snoke found it first and the secrets he uncovered there allowed him to ammas his power and corrupt Ben Solo's mind. He becomes so narrow minded about it that he nearly convincess himself he's not full of shit and he's not just running away from his guilt and from facing his friends. Luke's biggest fear is letting people down and we get to see that fear consume him while he's trying to run away from it. Maybe his fear of dissapointing others is why he's reluctant to train Rey in my version. 

Luke's flaw in this film, much like ours, is that his focus isn't where it sould be. He's so obssessed with Snoke and redeeming Ben that he forgets to truly look at and see his own nephew. Blinded by his love for the boy he convincess himself that he must be on this path because of Snoke's influence. What we learn though is that Ben is the one who sought out Snoke in search of guidence but he was reluctant to fully commit untill that incident with Luke pulling out his lightsaber on him(that one stays as it was). That also aligns with Ben's overall struggle with himself and the pull of the light which only fuels Luke's missguided attempts to save him. 

The reason why Luke can't face his fear is because in order to do so he would have to give up somethig of immense value in return. He would have to admit to himself that not everyone can be saved regardless of circumstancess. A classic case of his greatest strength being his biggest weakness as well. I believe it's much more interesting to challenge a character like that on something they believe they know and have them reevaluate it, rather than trying to teach them something new. Handling failure is a leason that was drilled into Luke way back in Empire so it doesn't make sense to me to have him relearn it here as well. In my version he is trying to deal with his failure but he is going about it the wrong way and has to correct himself. So, what do you guys think? 

P.S. Whether he lives or dies im still not sure. Im leaning toward lives though because i don't think a single movie is enough for that kind of arc. Plus with all the other stuff happening (im not up to the task of rewriting the whole movie just yet) it'll be far too packed. ",My personal version of Luke's arc in The Last Jedi.
393,"Honestly, I think I've reached my breaking point in so many places with the community.

When a contingent of clone troopers on the planet Murkhana refuses to open fire on Jedi Masters Roan Shryne and Bol Chatak, along with Padawan Olee Starstone, the Jedi with whom it has fought alongside during the war, Emperor Palpatine orders Vader to investigate the matter. Vader's query soon becomes a hunt for the fugitive Jedi, and takes him back to Coruscant, and from there on to Alderaan and Kashyyyk. During the course of Vader's search the whereabouts of several characters from Episode III, including Bail Organa, R2-D2 and C-3PO, Chewbacca, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, are revealed. The beginnings of Vader's partnership with Grand Moff Tarkin are also shown. 
Luceno devotes much of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader to the internal conflict that Darth Vader undergoes as he tries to shed his former identity of Anakin Skywalker and relearn to master the Force. Palpatine intends for these early missions that he sends Vader on to be as much about learning what it means to be a Sith as they are about consolidating the rule of the nascent Empire.

The final chapters of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader depict the beginning of the Imperial enslavement of the Wookiees of Kashyyyk, an act that will eventually lead to the partnership between Han Solo and Chewbacca.

The novel ends with Obi-Wan Kenobi learning of Vader's survival after their duel on Mustafar (depicted in Revenge of the Sith). Fearing for safety of the infant Luke Skywalker whom he is watching over, he communes with the spirit of his late master Qui-Gon Jinn, who tells him that Luke will grow to confront his father when the time is right and that Darth Vader will never return to Tatooine; as Qui-Gon explains, the planet is the whole of everything that was Anakin Skywalker, someone Vader wants to forget forever.

It is revealed that the general public of the galaxy believes that Anakin Skywalker perished in the attack on the Jedi Temple (which Skywalker led as Darth Vader).

I remember reading this novel the week it came out and I was absolutely enthralled with it. It is definitely one of the highlights of the old expanded universe. It is an excellent character study on Darth Vader and his internal conflicts shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith. However, I feel like a lot of the internalized plot points that the author touches on would be very difficult to convey on screen. We all know that there are things in novels that just do not work when translated to the silver screen. There is so much more detail and novels. And all of that stuff would be lost when trying to do it on the screen. I also would love to change the timeline and make it further away from order 66. It needs to be about a year or two after the events of episode three. 

First of all considering that Vader is always wearing his helmet, you can't really delve too deeply into his expressions and his emotions in a compelling way. The only way to make these kind of scenes work is when Vader is alone, meditating, in his chambers. And you can use flashbacks/force backs to convey his pain and regret. I have not spent a lot of time thinking about what I would change exactly. This post is something I came up with this morning, I'm just sitting around being bored.

The Jedi characters we will be following are not characters that we have spent considerable time with before. And the same can be said of the bounty hunter characters that I would like to introduce. I have not spent much time at all thinking about how I would adapt this story. All I know is that I think it would be one of the very best standalone stories that could be done. Everyone seems to be obsessed with the idea of a Kenobi character study, and I think one on Vader would be just as compelling. The Skywalker saga is the story of Anakin, and experiencing his grieving of Padme and his betrayal of the Jedi is the biggest potential of any standalone story, to me. 

My pick for director is Zack Snyder!!!

Give Snyder 7 Jedi in hiding. One Master. 3 Knights. 2 Padawans. 1 Youngling. Vader hires bounty hunters to give the Empire intel on potential Jedi still out there. Set it on a backwater planet that was once a Republic stronghold.

It's a year and a half after Order 66. The Emperor is displeased with Vader losing to Kenobi, and challenges him to prove his worth to The Sith and to The Empire. Sidious tasks Vader with the mission of eradicating what could be up to 1000 Jedi still living across the Galaxy.

416,"Let's assume that a redeemed Vader had survived the Death Star finale of RotJ, and lived long enough to compose an account of his life. Let's also assume he was powerful with a pen in his hand. How do you think he might write it?

Some of my favourite novels are written through the first person narrative, and I enjoy stories told as a series of diary entries, so as a Star Wars fan it's a question I love to ponder. The storytelling in the 6 films is omniscient as much as possible, and while I've no complaints with that, I feel the personal reflection of a key character would greatly compliment the lore. 

It would be fascinating to read Anakin's own words - after a long career fighting for Darth Sidious, which his son eventually liberated him from, he is bound to have a lot to say about that faithful period on Coruscant when he turned.

He could argue that he had revenge on Palpatine when he threw him off the Death Star in VI, but as a redeemed Jedi master I assume he would be beyond petty feelings of vengeance. This is, after all, a man who did many despicable things, and the regret from this would surely outweigh any jubilation from overthrowing an Emperor, as fundamental as that act was to the galaxy.

It's quite poetic that though it was family that helped Anakin plunge into darkness, it was also what helped free him. The former as utter tragedy, the latter as atonement. Whenever I watch the scene where Vader looks on at Sidious torturing Luke, I can't help but think of all the issues that must have been going through his head. I like to think that it was here Anakin realised Sidious was complicit in his wife's death, and would not let it repeat with his son.

Anakin would surely have a lot to write about the short, albeit happy, 3 years he spent as a loving husband. It would undoubtedly be more mature that what we see depicted on screen in AotC, but as touching as the best scenes from RotS. At face value Star Wars is exactly that, battles in space, but behind it lies human relationships: the brotherhood between Anakin and Obi-Wan, the romance between Anakin and Padmé. A memoir might lean a little too heavy on the human aspect for action fans, but it would be for the better.",[general discussion] The memoirs of Anakin Skywalker

Now I'm not saying this friend was wrong for thinking this or that any of you are wrong for thinking this either.

What I think is questionable is this notion that a supposed Obi-Wan, should one ever get made, make Black Panther levels of box office. I think it would do better than Solo but not by much I feel.

It sits in the same category of ""unwarranted, this only appeals to the fans, answers a bunch of trivia."" The general audience really doesn't care for stuff like this hence the ""success"" of Solo was largely came from the fans. And the fans are never enough to keep a franchise going. 

Who is realistically, outside of the fans, going to pay for a ticket to see Obi-Wan do things for two hours? I like Ewan McGreggor as Obi-Wan but that is not enough to warrant an entire film about it.

You don't have to like TFA or TLJ but they did well for being simple, straight forward films that embraced diversity and welcomed new audiences all around.

But what do I know, maybe if the film ever does get made it will be crazy successful and this post will be dated.

One question I had during our discussion is whether Han still had some brain activity while frozen. For example, could he dream while he was in hibernation, or was it like a complete comatose state? If he had cognitive activity, to what extent?  


Also, would the length you are frozen affect you when you were thawed? Obviously we know that you have hibernation sickness, but my friend thought that the effects of hibernation sickness would get much more damaging the longer a person is frozen. Would hibernation sickness get significantly worse the longer someone is frozen, potentially causing permanent damage? Or would the effect largely be the same regardless of how long you are frozen, with a person just recovering quicker if they are frozen for a shorter length?   


The Wookiepedia entry on carbonite is surprisingly slim, which is part of why I decided to ask you all if you had any more information about carbon freezing.

440,"It seems like for every Star Wars film, there's someone who's going to find plenty to criticize it. Prequels, sequels and originals alike. They might find them boring. They might find them written badly. They might dislike the special effects or the action or the acting. Whatever the case is, I think we can all agree that opinions on each film *hugely* vary.

Now, for the games on the other hand, aside from EA's stuff, Kinect Star Wars and *maybe* The Force Unleashed, I've not seen much negativity. Granted, I'm talking about the *big* games. Not the small ones that nobody even knows exist. I'm talking stuff like Knights of the Old Republic, the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games, Jedi Academy, Republic Commando, Rogue Squadron, classic Battlefront, Empire at War, Podracing, even the Lego games. They're *almost* in a universally positive light. Granted, I'm aware that their audiences are far smaller than the film audiences, so it's kind of a ""No shit"" that there would be fewer vocal opinions, but still.

Knights of the Old Republic is deemed by many as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.

X-Wing and TIE Fighter are praised for their ability to put players in the perspective of a pilot with deep gameplay.

Republic Commando is praised for its focus on its squad-based gameplay.

Jedi Academy is praised for its lightsaber combat.

So, yeah. Thoughts?","It's occurred to me that some Star Wars games get more praise, both from Star Wars fans and general audiences, than the films do."

So I guess it's retconned? I mean it makes sense; super speed is one of the most OP super-powers ever, and you have to maintain some tension for Jedi since they shouldn't be as gods. Are you comfortable calling it a retcon or do you think it's some kind of lost knowledge from long ago?","So, can Jedi run super fast or not?"

443,"I was hesitant to buy this since I already have the Blu Ray versions of the films, and the only upside was the fact that I can watch them anywhere. But for $100 that didn’t seem worth it. I tried to look at reviews and such to see if there were any perks. Once I saw that they had the legacy content as well as all the other features, I thought why not get it as it would be a great place to have everything in one location. I was very satisfied with my purchase for a couple of reasons:

The Collection: where on the blu rays you navigate the figures yourself, these come in one video that is much more efficient and convenient in my opinion and gives me more incentive to look at and appreciate them.

The legacy content is built in so you don’t have to pull out the old dvds or look for them on YouTube.

Finally, the biggest surprise of them all is the Conversations. These are tremendous pieces of Star Wars history and insight that we haven’t seen before. Sure we have heard from the big names all the time in the documentaries or other features, but these are conversations with the people behind the scenes in the film industry and I found that they were hidden gems of content I didn’t know I needed.

Even though I have watched these movies and features countless times, this collection revitalized my love for Star Wars again and reminded me of the joy and love that Star Wars gave to me. Thank you for reading and may the force be with you.

After doing some general research about The Old Republic (MMORPG not organization) I feel like technology slowly stagnated after some 3000 years and it finally hit its low point at the time of the Galactic Empire. All of the Sith Lords have this technologically advanced armor with pipes and lights and stuff all over it from Jadus’s mask to Kallous’s whatever. I’d even say the Eternal Empire is even more advanced and after that it just all goes away. The Sith are there but by Bane and Kaan’s time they aren’t nearly as advanced as the old empire. Later on after the republic demilitarized that’s when the stagnation really began because there was no military to advance anything. Fast forward and I’d say the Clone War brought the galaxy out of stagnation with both sides advancing AI technology and clone trooper armor. But as soon as the Empire reigns it all goes away.  The armor sucks, the weapons suck, the star fighters are terrible, every Imperial project fails, and arguably the ISD might be one of the worst designed ships I’ve ever seen.

*Anakin Skywalker discovers that the Sith have infiltrated the Jedi council. Palpatine was just a decoy for the real attack. Darth Sidious has been secretly hiding within the Jedi masters the entire time, weakening the Jedi, influencing their decisions to ones which would alienate them from the Republic.*

*Anakin rushes to The Works to stop Sidious from enacting his final plan, which would wipe out the Jedi and bring rise to a Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan Kenobi learns the truth too late to stop Anakin from rushing in alone. The Jedi temple is under attack from the Republic, there is not much time, the Jedi are spread too thin. This all happened too fast.*

*Anakin walks into the hot manufacturing plant as the monster, masquerading as the Jedi master he had admired for years, turns to face him and smiles. Darth Sidious activates the security locks in the room, trapping one with the other. There is a brief silence as they gaze at one another before Anakin unsheathes his lightsaber and charges at the Sith Lord. Their battle begins as Obi-Wan arrives too late and looks on helplessly through a force field door, just as he had years prior. Red and blue lightsabers strike through the heated air as laughter begins to circulate the room. Sidious doesn’t say a word. As the lightsabers crackle against each other, the room begins to lose its focus... Anakin knows he has to win. He cannot let Sidious live. Fear of what would happen to Padme flows through his mind. Fear of what would happen to those he cared about. Each strike with a lightsaber is more violent then the last.*

*Sidious reaches out and taps into Anakin’s fear and clouds his mind. Anakin begins to feel his mind being pulled away and thoughts begin to take hold that exist in the darkest corner of his soul. Sidious is too powerful. Anakin thinks about the things in the Jedi order which he disagreed with. Pieces he could not reconcile. The children taken from their parents to become soldiers. The lack of justice for those who needed it. The bureaucracy stopping them from protecting the weak*.......***No justice.... They were afraid of him.... Pushed him to the side.... Kept him at an arms distance because of his dissenting views...*** *Anakin can feel himself losing his mind. He keeps fighting it until he sees behind the red lightsaber is no longer Sidious, but his brother, Obi-Wan Kenobi.*

*Sidious found a way into Anakin’s mind through his fear and has begun destroying him from the inside out. Anakin fights the figure of Kenobi to a drop off area where there is burning hot metal twenty feet below them. Sidious has been toying with him, as his force mind control has been clouding his vision, and in the guise of Obi-Wan, disarms Anakin and cuts off his legs and arm and allows him to fall to the burning hot metal, as Obi-Wan screams from behind a soundless door.*

*The Sith lord picks up Anakins burned wreckage as he activates the final piece of his plan and the building starts falling apart around them. His body and his mind destroyed. Obi-Wan watches helplessly as they fly away.*

*-------*

*Obi-Wan is attempting to escape with the younglings on the republics ship when he is confronted by Darth Vader. Obi-Wan knows immediately who is behind the armour. He can feel him. Obi-Wan momentarily cannot speak, and refuses to fight. He calls out for his brother. Vader unsheathes his lightsabre and attacks Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan pleads with him, refusing to strike back, only defending the blows. He doesn't realize that Anakin Skywalker is gone, only Darth Vader remains.*

*Vader finally understood it was the Jedi who were destroying the galaxy. Who were stealing children. Who were building an army to take over the galaxy and protect only who they saw fit. Vader can now bring order. He can deliver justice. He can give power to the weak. The Jedi were a cancer. They used the excuse of their self made bureaucracy and allowed the deaths of millions who begged for life. The Jedi could not protect Padme, could not protect his child, and they need to be destroyed for order and justice to be restored to the galaxy.*

*“This is not you Anakin. The Sith Lord has poisoned your mind, destroyed your thoughts. It is not too late! Please...Anakin come with me.”*

*“It is far too late, Jedi.”*

*As the dock doors began closing on the escape pod housing the younglings, Darth Vader uses the force and violently tears the pod off his ship before the doors can seal. There is a loud cry, and then silence. Obi-Wan screams. He helplessly reaches out to the children he vowed to protect, as they float lifelessly in space. Obi-Wan finally sees that this is no longer is brother, there is no longer an Anakin Skywalker. There is only Darth Vader. And he engages in battle with no words. There is no gracefulness to this fight, there is no dance. There is only pain, only loss, only the death of a family as each lightsaber blade hits and hits.*

I won't spoil it for any of you reading this that haven't read any spoilers, but let me say this: It delivers. I'm not ashamed that I cried a few times during the movie either. It's emotional.

No, what I'm going to write about is my actual experience and how it turned out to be a day I will never forget, a once in a lifetime experience. It's pretty neat getting to be a Star Wars fan in the bay area, considering George Lucas himself is from around here. That sentence is a perfect prelude into the events that happened today.

I woke up at 5:04 a.m. My alarm was supposed to go off at 5am, but I guess my wife hit the snooze button. As soon as I opened my eyes, I shot out of bed like a blast from the death star. Got in the shower, showered in record time, put my clothes on, waited for my buddy to finish getting ready, and we were out the door at 5:35 a.m. Our destination was Lowes Metreon theater in San Francisco. All Lucas employees were given a choice to see Episode III at one of four theaters around the bay area. We chose Lowes because it was the only one with a digital display. What a lucky pick that turned out to be!

We got to San Francisco around 6:20 a.m. Parked the car, and got straight in line outside. We were about 20th or so. The doors weren't going to open until around 9 a.m., so we had some waiting to do. Those three hours however went by faster than you could imagine. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and to be that immersed with fellow fans and people who work for ILM and Lucasfilm was purely amazing. Ryan Church, and his team of artists that did all of the designs and art for Revenge of the Sith were right ahead of us in line. I talked to him a little bit about what it was like seeing the things he drew 3 years ago being put up on the big screen and being bought by guys like me in toy stores around the world. His answer is what you would imagine, he said it was ""just amazing.""

We all played Star Wars trivial pursuit for about an hour until around 8:45 a.m. when someone right behind us said ""have you looked at how big the line is lately?"" So I stepped out of line and looked all the way down the street. There were over 1500 people in line waiting to see the employee screening of the film! And these were people who actually worked on the film! I was #20 or so, and the guy who was the principal of photography must have been #1248! That's crazy! How did I get so lucky?!? I thanked God right there! People who have worked for George their entire lives were walking all the way to the end of the line. Hey, the handout they gave all of us said specifically ""No saving places in line, or seats.""

9 a.m. finally rolls around and the line starts to move inside the theater. They grabbed that green ticket that you can see above the first paragraph and off we went. The only theater in the entire building that was playing the movie digitally was theater number 15. So walking as fast as I possibly could without getting in trouble for running, I made it to theater 15. To my amazement, no one was sitting in the middle rows yet, so I hopped right in and sat down. As soon as my butt hit the seat, one of the ushers said ""Excuse me sir you can't sit there."" I said ""Excuse me? I've been in line since 6:30. I think we should be able to sit wherever we want!"" Nicely, but firmly the usher quipped back, ""Sorry sir, those seats are for George and his family"".
The usher didn't need to say anything else. I knew exactly who George was before she even finished that sentence. George Lucas was going to be watching Episode III with all of us. Whoa. I needed a seat after hearing that. So I climbed up about 4 rows where the seats weren't reserved anymore and sat down.

About 15 minutes passed and I got to talking to the girl next to me. Her name was Maggie. She works at ILM. Right in the middle of one of her sentences she says ""Oh my God, there's Robin Williams!"" And sure enough, grabbing his seat 3 rows ahead of us was Mork himself. I guess he was trying to be inconspicuous and go low-profile, because he was wearing the brightest orange shirt I've ever seen.

A few minutes passed and out of my right I see a gray haired guy in the same row as Robin Williams talking to a few people. It was the man. For the first time in my life, not only was I in the same room as George Lucas, but I was actually looking at him in real life, not via my tv. Time stood still for a few moments. Somewhere, God was smiling for me. I don't know how George slipped in without thunderous applause, but somehow he did. I was waiting for people to start whispering and then go into thunderous applause, but it never happened. George just shook hands and hugged the people around him, and then went over about 8 chairs to sit next to Robin Williams for about 10 minutes.

I would have loved to have heard what they were saying, because every 30 seconds or so, they both started laughing out loud. I'm sure Robin Williams was being his usual self, but I can count the times on two fingers that I've seen George Lucas laugh. He is always very serious and diplomatic when he gives interviews, so it was candid to see him relaxed and jovial. I really wish I could have been able to hear them, but seeing it was pretty neat too.

After George went back to his seat and settled in, the lights dimmed. Everyone cheered before anything was even shown on the screen. They showed a 10 second Digital Screen promo and then BOOM, right into the 20th Century Fox logo. Applause. Lucasfilm logo. Thunderous ovation. STAR WARS. Louder than any movie theater cheer I have ever heard or been a part of. Now I'm not going to describe how great the movie was, or anything about it. I'm sure you can read one of any number of reviews on the internet right now. Like I said, it delivered. This is the movie that Star Wars fans have been waiting for since 1983 since Return of the Jedi.

As I watched the film in awe, not really comprehending that I was actually sitting in the same theater with George Lucas, Robin Williams, Rick McCallum, the art dept, etc etc, I couldn't help from doing something from time to time. I found myself every 10 or 15 minutes looking a few rows ahead of me at George watching to see his reaction to his own creation. Granted I couldn't see his facial expressions, but he was just as into it as the rest of us. Applauding when the rest of us applauded, laughing at the jokes that he undoubltedly wrote himself. Surreal is all I can say. I get goose bumps just writing about it right now. At one point during the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight, he leaned to the person on his left and whispered something in his ear. As much as I wished I could hear what he and Robin Williams were talking about, I would have given just about anything to hear his own commentary on his film. Sure, you can hear his commentary on the DVD when you buy it 6 months from now, but that's not the same as when it's all fresh in his head and he is not being interviewed or otherwise recorded for future reference. I bet he was saying things that he'll never repeat again.

After the final scene, the blue font credits appeared. George's name was first. My friend and I were the first and only people to stand up and start cheering. Everyone else remained seated while they applauded. And that's the difference between myself and every other Star Wars fan. I love these films. They are a part of me. Standing up to thank the man who was responsible for it all was a natural reaction. I'm also proud to say that I was the only person who yelled ""THANK YOU GEORGE!!"" as I applauded. The clapping went on throughout the entire credits. It would get louder as the people who were in attendance names appeared on screen. You'd hear a section in the lower left corner cheer really loud as someones name came on, and other parts of the theater as well when other names appeared. Not one person left during the credits. Not one person. After the final credits rolled, and the lights came on, everyone finally stood up and looked at George. The whole theater knew where he was sitting. We all turned to him and clapped for at least another 2 minutes. Finally, when we had stopped, George said something. ""Thank you everyone, without you all, this wouldn't have been possible."" And to that I say, No George, thank you. Without you, none of this would have ever happened in the first place.

After the movie, all four theaters that the film was shown at throughout the bay area converged at the new site for Lucasfilm, ILM and Lucasarts, at the Presidio. We had lunch inside the building which was decorated with 20 foot posters from the film, and many of the costumes and props as well. At one point, right before I left, George Lucas was standing around 3 or 4 people. He wasn't really talking to them, as he seemed to be just taking it all in. I realized I was staring at a once in a lifetime moment. So I walked up to him, put my hand on his back and said ""George, my name is Ricky Borba and I just wanted to say thank you for Star Wars. You have no idea what it means to me."" After I finished my sentence, George extended his hand out towards mine, I grabbed it and we shook hands. He said ""Ricky, it's my pleasure.""

And I believe him. He loves Star Wars just as much as I do. ","I watched Revenge of the Sith with George Lucas in 2005, two weeks before it came out. My blog post went viral before viral was a thing..."

483,"Now let me explain my stupidity, I'm more of a new fan, at least I wasn't an SW fan until 2013. I really didn't like prequels when I first watched them. I'm still not fan of dialogues and overuse of CGI, but I came to love these movies in their own way.

It's just incredible how much of prequels I have misinterpreted and how many details I have missed. Some of the examples:

- The biggest thing I misinterpreted, was the fact that movies were clearly showing flaws of the Jedi and the fact that those flaws were what lead to their downfall. I thought that trilogy was actually trying to show Jedi as super duper good guys, while Siths were super duper bad. 

- I found myself surprisingly rooting for Anakin in many cases, while on my first watch I was getting angry at him. Like on how council treats him, even though he was serving for them for years now. How terrible some of their teachings and advices were

- I also loved the little detail that Jedi think Anakin is too old. I interpreted as a showcase of how Jedi want to indoctrinate children rather than truly explaining them their ideologies and such. 

- The fact that Obi Wan says that if Qui Gon was more obedient, he would've been part of a council. Another scene that shows how Jedi are afraid of different opinions. Also, Qui Gon was probably the wisest character in prequels.

- The terrible ""lack of attachment"" rule, which I hated at first thinking of how dumb it is that ""good guys"" have this rule, but now I realize that it is another way of showing how much flawed Jedi were and how insecure they were about their ideology. One of my especially favorite scenes is where Anakin in desperation comes to Yoda for advice on how to save Padme, yet he can't reveal anything because of this rule. Yoda on the other hand gives him horrendous advice, tells him to let it go, how tf is he going to let his pregnant wife go? 

- Obi Wan pulling his lightsaber first instead of trying to talk to Anakin and leaving him there to burn. At first I thought it was inconsistent with the originals, because Jedi were usually the last to pull it out, but now I see that it was intentional, showing how Obi Wan let his anger take over. 

- I still don't like Yoda bouncing off ridiculously, but I love how him having a lightsaber in prequels and not having them in originals subtly shows his development and how he changed. 
 
There are so much more, it will take ages to write. Just wanted to share the fact that I came to appreciate these movies. It's really sad what happened to Jake Lloyd. 

Hayden Christensen also got lots of undeserved hatred, even though I thought he was pretty good, especially in ROTS (the scene in council room where he looks at Padme through a window was especially very well acted). YES, there were scenes where he was cringey, but I don't think you could act out those lines better lol. It's really sad that he doesn't get much roles anymore, before SW came out, he even got an Golden Globes and Screen Guild Awards nominations for his role in Life as a House. Guy was getting somewhere, but role that was supposed to give him a boost, instead took everything. ",So I rewatched prequels for the first time!!!!! (TLDR)

491,"This is a character who wants power for power's sake.  He is actively trying to rid himself of whatever light is within him.  He's not like Vader, who fell to the dark side because he thought the power could help him save his loved ones.  No.  Kylo doesn't care about the people who should be his ""loved ones.""  He rather sees them as rivals who need to be overcome/surpassed.

This is why I find him so fascinating.  He's understandable without being sympathetic.  He comes from a lineage of powerful and important people.  His family changed the course of galactic history.  The life of a regular Jedi would be insufficient for someone like him.  He needs to fulfill the potential of his bloodline.  And that's what he thinks he's doing.

We're talking about the grandson of Darth Vader.  The nephew of Luke Skywalker.  The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa.  His grandfather was the iron fist of the Galactic Empire.  The Sith who destroyed the Jedi Order.  His uncle was the Jedi who brought down Darth Sidious's tyrannical regime.  His father was the infamous smuggler and heroic Rebellion general who helped destroy both Death Stars.  And his mother was the Princess of Alderaan.  The face of the Rebel Alliance.  And one of the most influential leaders of the New Republic.

I can see why he'd feel like it was his destiny to rule the galaxy.  It's one of the only things left for a Skywalker to accomplish.  The family that was born of the Force into slavery and rose to become the most powerful family in galactic history.  He his the apex of his bloodline.

Does this mean he can't be redeemed?  No.  But should he be?  I'm not so sure.  The Skywalker name can live on without him.  Luke is now an eternal Force ghost.  Rey can take on the Skywalker name for herself.  The galaxy doesn't NEED their bloodline.

And let's be real here:  The primary reason people want him redeemed is so the Skywalker bloodline can continue.  But in and of itself, that's not a good ""narrative reason"" why he should be redeemed.

EDIT:  I see a lot of people claiming that Kylo Ren cares about his mom and Rey.  While it's true that he INITIALLY couldn't fire at his mother towards the beginning of TLJ, he's ready to mercilessly slaughter her and the rest of the Resistance at the end of the film.  And that includes Rey.  ""I'll destroy her and you and all of it.""  That's him rejecting ANYONE who cares about him.",I don't understand the notion that Kylo Ren needs/deserves redemption.

498,"In terms of how it operates in the story, I mean. A lot of people seem to misunderstand Star Wars to a degree and see the darkside as just a set of powers and Balance as lining up that set of powers with ""light"" aligned powers. But that's not what the darkside truly is. The darkside is literally best personified as evil itself, the darkside is called such not because of the power but the usage and intent, the darkside is using the force for evil. 

One argument I saw someone else on Reddit use is that the Darkside is best understood as being like the One Ring in Lord of the Rings. Asking why Luke, Rey, or any other Force user can't just use the darkside without turning evil is like asking why Aragorn or Frodo can't just claim the ring to defeat Sauron. Doing that goes against inherent properties of the thing they're trying to use, just as the Ring always corrodes the user and will always obey the Will of Sauron, the Darkside always corrupts the user and always warps whatever good intentions they might have. Just like the only choice for Aragorn or Frodo was to refuse the Ring's temptation and refuse to wear it, the only choice for a Jedi is to refuse the darkside, the call to selfish desire.",Would you say that the Darkside is best compared to the One Ring of power?

If you don't like them, I wont end up changing your mind.  I get it, they have flaws.  So did the prequels, hell, so did the original trilogy.  But for me, I love all of them.  They just remind me of a time where everything was great.  Even when they're bad, they're entertaining.

I went to see The Last Jedi with my father who saw all the originals as a kid, he absolutely loved it.  In fact he was just giddy the entire time.  That's the closest I've ever seen him being a kid again.

Initially, I was upset with the direction the writers took with Luke, but I ended up understanding. He's still human, he will have flaws.  It's just natural.  Honestly, all I did was just try and put myself in his shoes, and I probably would have done the same.  I think the Original Trilogy is so romanticized that people just completely forget about it's problems.  I mean, I love them but they're certainly not perfect. 

And really, we've had some of the most awesome and iconic shots from these new movies.  There's both Finn and Rey igniting the lightsaber for the first time, Darth Vader in the last 2 minutes of Rogue One, the throne scene in TLJ, Maul in Solo, and still so much more I'm probably forgetting.  Even with poor writing, you really can't deny they are very beautiful movies.

528,"I think the films are reasonably enjoyable on a superficial level. Visually they’re absorbing and even better sonically. The scores are among the best ever written. I like the whole idea, the fairy tale world. But the stories are so weak and immature. Look at how most of the films end. Big showdown, the baddies lose, then all of a sudden it cuts to the goodies having a big celebration, roll credits. 

Sure it’s just a movie. And that’s alright for just a movie. But the whole mystique makes me hope for more. But there isn’t more. The stories are poorly written; the characters are unsympathetic; and there are no deep meanings to be found anywhere, no matter how much one might wish. There’s really nothing profound. 

Like I said, I do find the series enjoyable, but it’s only bubblegum. How can people take it all so seriously? Looking for meaning where it doesn’t exist might prevent one from finding the right answers

The T 65B x wing was already an extremely capable fighter capable of reaching ludicrous speeds (I heard that in Legends they could reach 0.75c with the aid of a gravity slingshot) and the jump to light speed is accomplish by a sudden acceleration and the passing to Hyperspace. Knowing all this why does Poe's T 70, a more modern design, need an extra engine to aproach the Mandator IV? Initially I though the Dreadnought had some sort of gravity well generator that made fighters go slower, turning them into easier targets(it would kind of explain why every ship is moving so slowly in the battle), and it was necessary to arrive with a higher speed, but this was never metioned as far as I know. StarWarsExplained even said it was the highest recorded speed achieved by an X wing, if it was acceleration it would be as bad but speed?
I guess you could say due to the proximity to the planet it was a little harder to accelerate, because you would be affecting you orbit and might start falling to the planet, but I can't help but feel confused.",What was the extra engine in Poe's x wing for?(TLJ)

If the  midi-chlorians are the microscopic connectors to everything living in the galaxy, does that not make the Star Wars galaxy itself a living organism? I'm not talking about some blob that encompasses the whole of space for them, but something that we don't normally think of. (Thinking of Wankershim from Bravest Warriors) Also, just look at the wording below. A world at the *heart* of the galaxy. Also the *foundation of life*.

&amp;#x200B;

WOOKIE: The [Wellspring of Life](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wellspring_of_Life), a mystical [world](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Planet) located in the [heart](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Heart) of [the galaxy](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_galaxy), was the birthplace of a microscopic species that served as the link between the Living Force[\[3\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Planet-2) within all life forms and the infinite Cosmic Force.[\[6\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Priestesses-5) It was also the foundation of life,[\[3\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Planet-2) with all life forms serving a symbiotic host for the living organisms[\[1\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Episode_I-0) native to the wellspring.[\[3\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_Planet-2) In modern science these intelligent microbes became known as ""midi-chlorians.""[\[7\]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian#cite_note-Force_planet-6)

577,"I recently read the original Thrawn trilogy, and wanted to say some things about it and the franchise in general. I never posted here before so I don't know what the popular opinions are.

So, I'll just say to start that I decided to read the Thrawn novels after being dissatisfied with the new movies. Especially the Last Jedi. I didn't like the idea of the story and characters going in the directions those movies went. More on that later. But I heard about the Thrawn novels, and how they were considered to be relatively high quality. So I figured that if there has to be a sequel trilogy, then it might as well be something that I can actually consider good, and respects the original story. I read them, and overall thought they were good. Not perfect of course. There were some flaws. Maybe a bit too slow at times, and the smugglers stuff sometimes felt a little too disconnected from the main story. And the ending of The Last Command was a little rushed. Not the stuff on Wayland, that was fine. But the final space battle and the epilogue, felt like they could have been expanded on. Other than that, pretty good.

However, I don't really have any desire to read any EU books that take place after The Thrawn Trilogy. This is partially because I like stories that actually have endings, instead of just going on and on indefinitely. It also  partially because many of the things that I've heard about the books seem to go against the spirit and/or story of the original movies. I'm going to mention some spoiler stuff here. This stuff includes: The Empire being continually rebuilt again and again after seemingly being defeated for good multiple times. Luke turning to the dark side. The Emperor being cloned/resurrected. Luke and other Jedi eventually gaining abilities that go far beyond anything shown in the movies, to the point where they basically become demi-gods. The revelation that the empire was actually created to counter an antagonistic alien race. To me, all of this just comes off as massive retconning and revisionism, and also makes a lot of the stuff that happened in the original movies seem trivial and/or pointless. I actually wouldn't mind reading some more about some of the new characters that were introduced in the Thrawn books, and the Vong at least sound interesting for being something different, and not just the Empire again. But I don't want to have to deal with all of that other stuff that goes with it.

This also ties into part of the reason I don't like the new movies. Quality aside, they go out of their way to make what happened in the original movies feel largely like a waste of time. Decades have passed, and the Empire (albeit under a different name) is still around. Han seemed to just wander away going back to doing what he did before. Luke abandoned everything he believed in. And its basically the same conflict between rebels and empire again, just with some new faces. So if nothing that happened in the old movies really mattered, then why should I care? Why does any of this matter? Maybe what happens in these new movies will end up not mattering as well. This isn't even getting into the numerous plot holes and underdeveloped characters.

All I wanted was stories that managed to do something different and tell a different sort of conflict, but while still respecting the spirit and story of the original movies. Was that so much to ask? Apparently. At least the Thrawn trilogy was good. Ad as far as I'm concerned, that's where the story ends. No rebuilt empire. No resurrected emperor. No Luke turning to the dark side, or abandoning everyone. No secret ""justified"" reason for the creation of the empire. None of that. The Last Command might not have been perfect, but I'll accept it as the ending to Star Wars, because its better than the alternatives.

Anyway, those are my opinions. If anyone has any comments or other opinions, feel free to share them.",Opinions on The Thrawn Trilogy and Star Wars in general

586,"Hi folks! I've been watching again the SW in order (1 to 8) and the CW and just started Rebels.

One thing that I have observed is that the jedis seems to have less movement over the ages : in the prequels and CW, Anakin and Obiwan are pretty much jumping long distances and having acrobatic fighting stances (older jedis too, like Dooku) while in the OT and sequels, the lightsaber wielders seems to be much more ""static"" and melee fighting not as jumpy/acrobatic. 

Now, I understand that when the OT was made, animation and technology at the time couldn't allow this kind of acrobatic cinema as today. But is there an explanation in the SW universe that explains the changes in fighting stances over the ages ?

Disclaimer, I still love The Last Jedi and consider it the best so far of the Disney canon films, and I am fine with the angle of weapon and ship manufacturers profiting off of the war, after all the military industrial complex in real life makes a lot of money so long as there are conflicts to profit from.

That being said, the big reveal DJ showed is basically X-Wings and TIE Fighters come from the same seller. At first I thought Sienar Fleet Systems went bankrupt after the fall of the Empire, which would make sense, and Incom bought them out and got all their assets, meaning they would be the manufacturer of both X-Wing and TIE Fighters. But it turns out, according to Wookipedia, that's not the case. Sienar is now Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems and Incom is now Incom-FreiTek, so they are as far as I can tell still separate entities. There is very little info on Incom-FreiTek on the Wookiepedia, so I don't know if any of the Disney canon books go into more detail about the current state of that company.

It's possible that the owner of the ship is some kind of reseller of ships and just buys from both corporations and sells them back to the Resistance and First Order, or perhaps even that DJ misinterpreted why the owner of that vessel had plans for both X-Wings and TIE Fighters.

These are the only two head canons I can come up with to explain what otherwise seems to be an oversight on the movie's part, which is certainly possible.",Something that I realized doesn't ad up with DJ's reveal on the seller's ship.

604,"Rather than just giving my opinion on Luke in the Last Jedi, I wrote down the way I understand both sides of the argument. Please read my arguments. Any discussion should be either explaining why you agree with the side you do, or objecting to my characterization of that side.

​

Pro:

Luke in the Last Jedi is an older, more complex, and conflicted version of the character. While he may have said that he would never join the dark side, that's more complicated than Return of the Jedi suggests. Struggling with the dark side is something Jedi do constantly, not something that can be stopped once. Seeing a vision of Kylo Ren's future made him momentarily forget his allegiance to the light, and he drew his lightsaber. He immediately realized his mistake, but he grew to doubt himself because of it. Decideding that he wasn't able to be a Jedi master, he grew to question his teachings. Immediately, Luke Skywalker retreated to an island, and vowed not to train any other Jedi.

​

Con:

~~Any justification for Luke's drastic change requires doing an incredible amount of mental gymnastics.~~ The movie clearly wasn't concerned much with explaining Luke's transformation, using the flimsy excuse of a vision. Spending such little time explaining why his characterization changed is disrespectful both to the character and the beloved films. In fact, this change in Luke's character throws his arc over all 3 movies out the window. In Return of the Jedi, Luke said he would NEVER join the dark side. Changing that is just blatant disregard to what those movies and Luke's character stands for,

​

Edit: People seem to be objecting to the mental gymnastics line, so I cut it.​ The wording was harsh.

608,"Minas Tirith is the Resistance, trapped on the edge of destruction, with a seemingly unstoppable force bearing down on it. Only time separates them from certain death.

Faramir is Finn, compelled to face this threat at the cost of his own life.

Now according to some logical perspectives, Faramir *must* try to do this thing. Minas Tirith knows nothing of Aragorn and the Paths of the Dead, much less Frodo and Sam's Quest to Mordor. Likewise, the Resistance knows nothing of Luke's plan to save the day.

But that doesn't make Faramir's sacrifice any less meaningless. Faramir almost dies, not in the service of his kingdom, but to appease the madness of his father (just as Finn attempts to die not in defense of his friends, but in personal anger regardless of his friends). Yes, it was Minas Tirith's only known hope. But that doesn't make it a good idea.

So what happens? Faramir survives by the skin of his teeth, knocked into a coma from the trauma of his injuries, and then what? Do Gandalf and Pippin rush out in a last-ditch effort at attrition? No, they hold back and try to figure out the next step.

Rose didn't know Luke was coming, but she *did* know that a dead Finn wasn't going to do anyone any favors. So like Gandalf, she made an effort to save her friends for whatever the future would hold, even if it means facing death *again*.

My god, I was not prepared for Fives’ death. I’m gonna admit it, I cried. A lot. That was just depressing to see.

And before he dies, Fives says to Rex, “I was just trying to do my duty.” That just hurt me inside. Even the military police trooper that shot him took of his helmet and was upset with what he did.

643,"It’s kind of a Christmas tradition in my family to watch it.  I have a four year old, who will be almost 5 at Christmas, and I’m not sure if it might be a bit too much still.  We don’t watch tv in our house, it’s all movies and some kids shows via apps.  Probably the most violent thing he’s seen is Moana, Big Hero 6 or Up.  And nothing live action that I would consider violent, with perhaps Planet Earth series being the exception.  I know there is Clone Wars and Rebels, but I want his introduction to the SW universe to follow the release chronology, at least for the first three.  I think he is pretty mature in that he understands death (our dog and cat died in the last year) and in nature shows sometimes roots for the prey, sometimes for the predator.  I know judging a child’s maturity is highly subjective....


Anyway, perhaps I’m overthinking it, but my parents let me watch Alien when I was like 7 and I had nightmares for ages.  I don’t want this to be too much too soon—although I’ll probably hold off on ESB until next year.  What do you all think is an appropriate age?  When did you introduce your children?

GL: ....And also with Hayden in Episode II. He said, ""I don't want to be this whiny kid."" I said, ""Well, you are. You gotta be a whiny teenager.""

*RS: Like father, like son.*


GL: He said, ""I want to be Darth Vader."" I said, ""You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract."" Hayden was grateful for this last movie, where he actually got to be Darth Vader.

*RS : It was interesting how many people wanted to see Darth Vader massacre the Jedis.*


GL: Well, when I said I was going to do the prequels, everybody said, ""That's great, we get to see Darth Vader kill everybody."" And I said, ""That's not the story."" When I announced that the first story was going to be about a nine-year-old boy, everybody here said, ""That's insane, you're going to destroy the whole franchise, it's More American Graffiti all over again."" And I said, ""Yeah, but this is the story.""

I don't have energy to just make hit movies. I'm not going to make James Bond Pt. 21 – I'm just not interested. Everybody said to drop the stuff about the midichlorians, it makes it too confusing. But it's a metaphor for a symbiotic relationship that allows life to exist. Everybody said it was going to be a giant turkey: ""This isn't going to help LucasFilm at all."" I said, ""This is about the movie and the company is just going to have to deal with whatever happens."" That's one of the reasons why there was so much hype on the first prequel: Everybody was terrified.

*RS: Having thought of Darth Vader as this ultimate evil, it was alarming to see him as a cute kid in ""The Phantom Menace,"" as if we were watching home movies of Hitler.*


GL: Well, a lot of people got very upset, saying he should've been this little demon kid. But the story is not about a guy who was born a monster – it's about a good boy who was loving and had exceptional powers, but how that eventually corrupted him and how he confused possessive love with compassionate love. That happens in Episode II: Regardless of how his mother died, Jedis are not supposed to take vengeance. And that's why they say he was too old to be a Jedi, because he made his emotional connections. His undoing is that he loveth too much.",Interesting George Lucas interview on his decisions behind Anakin's character arc and midichlorians in the prequels.

666,"I don’t know about y’all, but LSWTCS was and probably still is my favorite game. However, with recent technology, the game is somewhat outdated. The character customization is limited, the cutscenes have no words (just passionate grunts), and the content is lacking a couple of episodes. All I’m saying is that TT games would have an absolute banger on their hands if they remade TCS, but this time included episodes 7 &amp; 8 (and 9 when it comes out). Even include Rogue One and Solo side missions. Throw in some multiplayer co-op, maybe some PvP if they’re feeling ambitious, and updated character customization, I’d easily pay $60 for that. For how simple it is, Lego Star Wars is one of the best Star Wars games. TT games could take advantage of that, making both themselves and the consumers happy.

Yes, there were some who admired him, but most, especially the public truly feared him. Same with Snoke, no one admired him and looked up to him, they looked at him with fear in their eyes and hearts. This leads me to Episode IX. I want them to do something different, I want Kylo to be loved by the public. He has brought order, stability, and peace to the galaxy, and the galaxy has entered a new golden era. This will make it hard for our band of heroes, as they won’t be able to get allies, as they will be seen as terrorists; wanting chaos and conflict, with the public looking down on them with contempt. Would make it hard for them to take down Kylo, as he’s making the galaxy thrive better than it has in the last 60-70 years and the citizens loving their new leader.

672,"I don't expect that I will change your minds, but I think that what I have to say does lend some credibility to the opposite side of the argument. Let me preface this with the fact that I do not want to come across as mean-spirited in any way. I respect that there are many of you who don't like the film, and the writing even less. If you still don't like the writing for whatever reasons and aren't toxic about it, that is perfectly fine.

I had seen TLJ twice before I went again to see it with my mom, who hadn't seen it yet. My own opinions on the movie were pretty much solidified at that point. I loved the movie, and I thought the writing was great for the most part. Now, here's something to know about my mom. She got a PhD in theater arts, with a dual concentration in writing and theater production. Her mentor was Edward Albee, the 3-time Pulitzer Prize winning playwright best known for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" According to my mom, he was a tough mentor, and she developed high standards for writing as a result.

After the movie was done, the first thing she said was, ""Who wrote that movie? That writing was absolutely incredible!"" Now, I know this sounds like me saying ""My mom said it was great so therefore it's great!"" But even if she wasn't my mom and just a random stranger, I think that it is safe to say that she has an extensive knowledge of what makes great writing (which I admit can be entirely subjective), and it is worth considering that someone who was personally trained by an award-winning world-renowned playwright thinks that the writing for TLJ is phenomenal (her words, not mine). Now, I know that writing a play and writing a film are different, but there is some significant overlap, so I believe that her opinion on the writing is a valid opinion, seeing that she was trained in a tangential but similar style.

When she asked about why it was so divisive, I tried to give her as unbiased an answer as possible. I mentioned, people weren't happy with Luke's portrayal, people saw it as abandoning the setups of TFA, various plot holes, etc. She flat out disagreed. So take that as you will.

I really want to hear everybody's opinions, but I am especially curious to know what those who were dissatisfied with the movie think of this. Normally I post in /r/starwarscantina, but since this subreddit has a higher amount of people who weren't happy with the movie, I think it would be better to make this post here. If you're still not convinced, I accept that. I just thought I had an interesting viewpoint to share.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Based on the feedback so far, I've decided to elaborate on her opinions. We're in completely different states right now and she's working so I'm not going to bother her and call her up and ask her for a write-up.

She rewatched TFA before seeing TLJ, and she felt that Luke's role in TLJ was set-up in TFA. She thought that Han pretty much stated it exactly in TFA that Luke ran away and felt responsible for causing the current conflict. She didn't think that the map had any importance, only as a MacGuffin, and that Mark Hamill's facial reactions at the end of TFA indicate that he's not happy about being found. So it made sense to her that Luke would be in this dark place during TLJ.

Her favorite parts were the Rey-Luke-Kylo Ren dynamics. She thought that the writing for Kylo Ren was a great metaphor for mental illness, and she liked the dichotomy between how Rey and Kylo Ren handled their parental issues differently. She guessed from TFA that Rey's parents were nobodies and that Rey was in denial about this, so to my mom, Rey accepting that she came from nowhere but could still be special was pretty powerful.

She loved the use of the Force in this movie. We come from a Hindu background, and she saw this movie as espousing Hindu philosophy to the clearest extent in any movie in the franchise than ever before. She said that at the heart of the Force/Hindu philosophy,  it's all about having mental strength and superiority. That's why Rey is so powerful, because she readily accepts the power of the Force and allows it to control her.

She liked Canto Bight because it felt like old-style Hollywood filmmaking to her. She saw it as important to the overall theme in Star Wars of helping those in need. Now this was where we disagreed. I recognized that it could have been written better, but to her, the fact that it was a learning lesson to Finn was enough for her.

She didn't think that Holdo should've told Poe the plan because as she said, ""he was an idiot and recklessly got the bombers killed"". On that note, she liked that everyone had a lesson to learn in this movie: Rey to find belonging in herself, Poe to become a better leader, Finn to start believing in a cause and stop acting selfishly, Luke to accept failure, etc.

She didn't care about Snoke's backstory or why there's an Empire 2.0. Nor does she care about whether hyperspace ramming breaks or doesn't break established lore.

What if some of the Knights, believing Luke to be dead and witnessing Ben and the others massacring the rest of the Jedi Temple, only chose to ""join"" Ben to stay alive and wait for a chance to take him out. I think this could be interesting because it could have Kylo Ren being threatened from all sides in Episode IX. You would have the Hux faction of the First Order against him, you would have Rey and the Resistance/New Republic remnants against him, and then you'd have some of his own Knights against him, which I think could lead to some cool things for his character.

1620,"Hey everyone, so one of the things that makes Star Wars so iconic is their use of making the audience read a series of words before the movie starts. It’s such an amazing risk that George Lucas took, but it paid off so much. I was wondering how everyone would rank the crawls. Each one definitely seems to set the tone for the movie, and have their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s my ranking:

A New Hope: so there’s a bit of bias here because this is also my favorite movie, but I just love the idea that George Lucas threw us into this huge galaxy by explaining it all in about 30 seconds. It’s a true testament to movie making and understanding your audience’s intelligence. Plus it also essentially created the plot for the amazing Rogue One. 

The Force Awakens: Luke Skywalker has vanished. Wow. Say what you want about the sequel trilogy, but I can not give JJ enough respect for the guts it took to start off like that. I had made my best effort to avoid all spoilers going into the Force Awakens, but my entire life I’ve been wondering what happens next (the now legends books took their approach but even from the start I never fully trusted them) and right away JJ showed us that this is very much new world and that Luke is not the hero of this story. Again, feel how you may about the sequel trilogy, but you have to respect the creative courage it took to take that approach. 

Empire Strikes Back: so similar to the force awakens, the previous movie ended on this glorious celebration of victory. But not all is as positive as it may appear to be. Right away this crawl explains that it is a dark time for the rebellion, and that we are about to witness a movie that will push our heroes in new ways. Making it one of the greatest movies for quite a lot of people (like I said a New Hope is my favorite, but I can respect that empire is the better film)

So now here is where I think we will see everyone’s ranking start to go all over the place:

Revenge of the Sith: War! Need I say anything else? Yes, it’s cheesy, but I love it. An issue I have with the prequels is that we don’t get to see the actual clone wars (an issue that has been slightly solved thanks to the clone wars animated series) but this crawl definitely helped fill this gap that was filled with quite a lot of losses and changes for our heroes. 

The Last Jedi: I’ll never forget the speculation leading up to the release of the Last Jedi. We all knew it would had by far the shortest time jump of the movies, so we wondered how on earth they could create a crawl for it. I really respect how this crawl made an effort to fill in the blanks left by the Force Awakens as far as politics and galactic control are concerned  

Attack of the Clones: this isn’t so much because of the crawl, but because George decided this would be the one movie that pans up after the crawl, leading to us all wondering every single time whether or not the pan will be up or down. 

Return of the Jedi: I think this crawl is a reason why a lot of people wondered what the Last Jedi would be able to do for theirs. The second shortest time between movies, it really doesn’t go to far into details. Yeah it explains Luke returns home, and there’s a second Death Star. But that’s it. The real perfection of this movies comes from the twists found in Jabba’s Palace, which the crawl certainly doesn’t give away. 

The Phantom Menace: The taxation of trade routes. Oof. Yeah, that doesn’t get you super excited. I appreciate the phantom menace for the fact it brought back star wars, and introduced us to Maul, one of my favorite canon characters. But we can all agree, we do not ever need trade route discussions in future Star Wars movies. 


Lastly just a quick ranking of the so far two movies without a crawl:

Rogue One: if you were to make each crawl into a visual presentation, I feel like Rogue One would be a perfect example of this. I could easily picture the opening just being described in words, but I love that they took the extra step and gave us some more screen time with Galen Erso. 

Solo: it’s a solid take on a screen crawl, separating it into separate slides, but it’s nothing special. ",Ranking The Opening Screen Crawls

1639,"With Lucasfilm seemingly having no clue what people want to see (Solo origin story with a recast Harrison Ford for example) and instead hoping for a director to have a story to tell people care about, maybe we should write down what we want.

It is okay to reuse characters from legends people already care about. We don’t need all new original characters all the time. Just improve on already beloved stories, like Marvel does, the fanbase will make the hypetrain qork and drive it to the mainstream audiences (also like Marvel does)

Even if Plinkett and other cynical youtube “reviewers” sas otherwise: People generally love lightsaber action.

What people mention the most on this sub:

-Old Republic with either the story of Darth Bane being told (which fits perfectly in the rest of the saga) or  the mandalorian wars with Revan

-Kenobi (the important difference to Solo is here that people love Ewan McGregor) on Tatooine, between the conflict of Tusken and moisture farmers. 

-gritty clones movie, cameos of Ahsoka, Ewan and Hayden, something like the battle of Jabiim, or labyrinth of evil or republic commando there are a lot of ideas out there.

-Thrawn whether as the villain or the protagonist. This guy is the most important EU character of all time and the posterboy of what people considered to be the sequel trilogy for many years. Maybe Zahns third canon novel should become a movie.

-Darth Plagueis he is a mystery and pulled the strings before Episode I. The fans love this character although not much is known about him. The movie would have to be more political and going into prequel territory, but if made well this could be the kind of “different” Star Wars film, the franchise needs.

- Vader. Since Rogue One a lot of people like the idea of a group of Jedi in the Dark times being hunt down by Darth Vader. 

-Knights of Ren/ New Republic/ Luke Jedi Order. Many people want something that fills the gap between the battle of Jakku and TFA that isn’t a book.

-Shadows of the empire. This is more interesting for the older generation of Star Wars fans. A multimedia project that got anything but a film should get a movie too. And let’s be honest: Benedict Cumberbatch would be the perfect Xizor.

-Boba Fett/ Bounty Hunters/ Underworld. This idea is growing in the fanbase since the first rumours of a live action series from George Lucas. People just want the concepts of 1313 to happen in any form.

-Episodes X-XII. This is for the far future, but should be
mentioned here nonetheless. Reys new jedi order has to face a new enemy that is not remnants of the empire. People tend to wish for the Grysks, which are everything people did like about the Vong.

What else is there? Do you agree/ disagree?

It would be Leia of course but sadly she will not be in the next movie. So that leaves only a few options. Rey? Probably not as she will most likely be doing Jedi things and too busy getting into lightsaber battles. Poe? Maybe but I feel he is a dangerous candidate because he is one of their best pilots they have and they will need that skill to succeed. Finn is barely a Resistance member and Rose is just a mechanic. I don't get why Chewie hasn't taken the Falcon and flown off into the sunset already and he seems to be more and more regulated to a side character. That leaves me with just one idea. He is a character that has been through so much. Lost so many friends and compatriots. He has been around since the beginning of everything. He even currently has a sizable spy force sprinkled across the galaxy. That is right. I think the new leader of the Resistance will be: C-3PO!

However, Kylo Ren appears as a sole emissary of the First Order on the battlefield, expecting Leia, Holdo, or another high ranking Resistance member to meet him to deliberate terms of surrender. The walkers loom in the background, and shots of the remaining Resistance members indicate their defeated demeanor, as many of them are moving into the acceptance of their inevitable death. 

Leia walks out into the salt flats, ready to face what’s left of her son. Once Ren sees that she’s away from the base and approaching him, he orders an all out annihilation of the remaining Resistance forces. 

We cut to multiple First Order TIE fighter pilots receiving the order via radio. “STANDING BY TO ENGAGE” is repeated multiple times. But then, right before Ren orders the fighters to attack, we hear a soft static overtake. “Red 5 standing by.” 

Imagine “March of the Resistance” from the Force Awakens soundtrack playing behind the following suggestion:

Both the Milennium Falcon and a Rebellion-era X-WING appears over the mountainside, two ships, parallel to one another. They drive alone, straight into the onslaught of oncoming TIE fighters and walkers. 

Ren orders every fighter to attack the Falcon, trying to rid himself of his own self-fulfilling pain. Luke, piloting the X-WING along with Rey, fly directly up to the edge of all 15 AT-AT walkers before turning parallel to their walking paths. As all of the available First Order firepower destroys the Falcon, Luke shouts “now R2!”. At that moment R2 ejects Luke’s green lightsaber from the X-WING. Luke then yells, “Rey!”. From the backseat of the X-WING, Rey uses the force to balance the ignited lightsaber a few feet from the right side of the X-WING while Luke flys down the row of AT-AT walkers, the saber slicing the front legs of every single one.

I'll now post this, proving that comment wrong, all while showing I'm just talking about my own opinions and thoughts.

Ok so in e6, Luke surrenders himself to the Empire for a variety of reasons. His motivation for this decision includes things like force users could sense him, so he had to get away from the rebels. Another reason is that Luke knew in his heart that Vader couldn't and wouldn't  kill him. 

His plan once surrendered was to turn Vader to the good side and prove the Emperor wrong.

What is the Emperor's thought process here? Well he knew Luke would end up alone with them, to confront them. Now his goal is to turn Luke to the dark side. He keeps talking about letting go and strike down his own father. Except the entire time Luke's there, he's acting like a pacifist. I really don't understand why the Emperor would think Luke would not only join the Dark side, but kill his own father to do so, with no motivation or reason to do so. This while Luke's trying to get Vader back to the light side with every fiber of his being. 

I will give the Emperor credit for making Luke want to kill him, which would lead to dark side emotions and Midiclorians, but it was played out in a really clunky way.",What's the deal with the Emperor's plan?

1754,"So I frickin' LOVE the Clone Wars.
I just finished the Ahsoka novel in like 4 days... But now I feel kind of empty...
