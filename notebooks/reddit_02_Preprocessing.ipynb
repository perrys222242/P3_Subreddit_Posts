For model training purposes, both sets of posts from the two sources need to be combined.  It was determined that the \"Star/star\" from the two franchise titles would not contribute to the evaluation of the two main  models examined, so the \"Star/star\" of those bi-grams were removed.  An inelegant way to perform the removal is used pending a search for better code in the form of a function."
